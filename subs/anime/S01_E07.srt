1
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,843
Love advice?

2
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,011
Yes!

3
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,847
I am facing a big problem.

4
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,599
{\an8}You are the love expert,

5
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,352
{\an8}so I thought only you
could solve this problem.

6
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,941
Well, there's no turning back now.

7
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,901
I will be with you on this journey
until the end.

8
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,985
President!

9
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,446
<i>Here we go again.</i>

10
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,615
<i>I don't think I can deceive him
much longer.</i>

11
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,076
<i>When did I become a love expert?</i>

12
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,161
<i>What are their qualifications
to acquire that title?</i>

13
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>If there is such a qualification test
for virgins, then I will take it!</i>

14
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>Giving advice to someone
who has a girlfriend is not a joke.</i>

15
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,877
<i>But because he asked me,
I'm going to simply listen to him.</i>

16
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,922
<i>Is that Kashiwagi's boyfriend?</i>

17
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,635
<i>I thought they were getting along well
by doing charity work.</i>

18
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,429
What do you need advice for?

19
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,098
Yes.

20
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,391
The thing is...

21
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,227
I would like to hold hands with Kashiwagi.

22
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,024
You know, it's been a month
since we started dating,

23
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,945
and I can't wait to do the things
that couples normally do.

24
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,613
That's why I want to ask, President.

25
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,991
How do you hold hands with a girl?

26
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,118
<i>Why don't you just get advice
from your friends?</i>

27
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,162
<i>Isn't this just bragging
that you have someone?</i>

28
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,998
<i>He said he wanted a love advice,
but isn't he just bragging about her?</i>

29
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:49,002
<i>Even the president, who is so generous,
will get angry at this.</i>

30
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,629
I see.

31
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,631
<i>What's with the face of a Buddha?</i>

32
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,467
<i>At least he is speaking of normal things.</i>

33
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,597
<i>Holding hands and other things,
it's like the ABC of love.</i>

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,973
<i>Even I can handle that.</i>

35
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,309
<i>The ABC of love.</i>

36
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,644
<i>When people say they are a couple,</i>

37
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,689
<i>the implication about the depth
of the relationship changes greatly.</i>

38
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:13,318
<i>The letters ABC are a barometer
that is used to measure that depth.</i>

39
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,402
<i>A is kissing,</i>

40
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,612
<i>B is touching,</i>

41
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,114
<i>C shows how much the relationship
has progressed.</i>

42
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,578
<i>He is a beginner who decided
to climb the mountain of this ABC.</i>

43
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,665
<i>In that note,
he is not that different from Shirogane.</i>

44
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,669
Okay. Holding hands is simple.

45
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,881
Sailing on a cruiser towards the horizon,
while watching the sunset,

46
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,675
let your fingertips brush against hers
until she notices it,

47
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,136
then you smile at her,
and, finally, grab her hand.

48
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:41,846
<i>That's a high bar.</i>

49
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,723
<i>But that sounds nice.</i>

50
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,226
<i>So that's how the president thinks.</i>

51
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,979
But I don't have the money
to rent a cruiser.

52
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,064
I see.

53
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,108
Then, how about landing a part-time job?

54
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,693
A part-time job?

55
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,903
Yes, part-time jobs are good.

56
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,365
You'll only realize how good tap water is
after you finish all of your work.

57
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm telling you, it's as tasty as a cola.

58
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,827
<i>Why don't he just drink a cola, then?</i>

59
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,665
-<i>The president looks like a workaholic.</i>
-I'm not saying it should be luxurious.

60
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,001
If it's small, you can rent it
for 10,000 yen.

61
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,837
But don't you need a license for boats?

62
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,048
A driver's license
for small boats is okay.

63
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,676
You can get this easily,
so I recommend getting one.

64
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,969
<i>He has one?</i>

65
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,805
Amazing! As expected of you, President.

66
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,391
If you go to the training institute,
you will get it in three days,

67
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,142
and the fee would be
less than 100,000 yen.

68
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,561
But 100,000 yen is a lot of money.

69
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,063
Then get a part-time job!

70
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>Why is he so obsessed
with him getting a part-time job?</i>

71
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,989
That scenario sounds good for sure,
but I was thinking of something simpler.

72
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,908
My hands tend to sweat a lot.

73
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:48,371
I'm scared to hold her hand
when mine are so sweaty.

74
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,709
In short, you're experiencing
excessive sweating on your palm!

75
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,128
I don't know, but that's probably it.

76
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,380
<i>Tell him to get a proper consultation!</i>

77
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,382
I think that you need
to undergo an operation.

78
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,094
The operation you need
costs around 100,000 yen!

79
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,933
So get a part-time job!

80
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,522
TODAY
OKINAWA, OGASAWARA

81
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,111
<i>Why do you want him to work so badly?</i>

82
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,738
Instead of your making your hands sweat,

83
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,282
having your forehead sweat
because of work is more constructive.

84
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,283
<i>That's too much!</i>

85
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,617
It's final, then.

86
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,996
I need a part-time job
in order to hold hands with her.

87
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,665
<i>That's wrong! It's not necessary at all!</i>

88
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,793
As it happens, at the place where I work,

89
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,920
they're in need of workers
for this coming summer vacation.

90
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,630
How about inquiring there?

91
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,590
President.

92
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,092
Don't worry about it, I will go with you.

93
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,428
The first job can be hard...

94
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,848
-<i>Notice that there is a basic problem.</i>
-...so I will support you!

95
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:53,269
The fees for the boat, the license,
and the surgery are about 200,000 yen.

96
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,856
The job pays 5,000 yen an hour,
so for five hours a day,

97
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,734
you would get it if you work for 40 days.

98
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,111
You're going to have
a fun summer vacation!

99
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,614
I... suppose?

100
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,283
<i>This is bad.</i>

101
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,787
<i>Just like that, the president's
summer vacation will be full.</i>

102
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,206
<i>All of the plans I made
for this coming summer vacation</i>

103
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,458
<i>will be all put to waste.</i>

104
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,086
About the interview...

105
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,712
Wait a second!

106
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,298
The color of her magnifying glass is pink.

107
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,217
This is what you call
a real colored glass!

108
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,260
I summon the Love Detective!

109
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,305
{\an8}Secretary Fujiwara and Shinomiya?

110
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,683
I won't allow you to talk
about romance without me.

111
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,935
Shinomiya.

112
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,228
It's not what you think.

113
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,522
I'm not an idiot.

114
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,940
<i>Somehow, she got caught up.</i>

115
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,692
Hey, what kind of advice are you giving?

116
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,777
Nothing at all.

117
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,197
He was asking about holding hands
with his girlfriend.

118
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,574
I see.

119
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,039
Can't he just hold hands with her?

120
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,458
What is there to worry about?

121
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,295
No. The problem is, there are tough
psychological hardships involve.

122
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,755
Like his sweaty palms.

123
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,759
Just when I had a feeling
you were talking about romance.

124
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,887
Is that how men give love advice?

125
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,681
It's cute, isn't it?

126
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,891
Are you saying there's nothing
to worry about?

127
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,437
There's nothing else to do
except doing your best!

128
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,939
Doing your best? That's vague.

129
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,899
That's not vague!

130
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,736
Getting nervous, hands are sweating,
and feeling embarrassed,

131
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,947
nevertheless, you...

132
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,910
Despite all that, you should still try
and hold hands with her.

133
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,038
Isn't that nice, huh?

134
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,959
If you don't try your best
and just hold her hands, then it's no fun.

135
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,588
Skipping the hard part
is fundamentally wrong.

136
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,006
Right?

137
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,092
Please reflect hard on it!

138
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,387
I see.

139
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,474
What I was lacking was the genuine effort.

140
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,809
Is it okay to just try?

141
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,270
Then a part-time job...

142
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,688
Is not necessary!

143
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,689
That can't be true.

144
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,566
I will do my best!

145
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,653
Well, it's not like
I've held hands with a guy...

146
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,739
<i>The following day...</i>

147
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:18,164
<i>he managed to hold hands
with Kashiwagi while on a date.</i>

148
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,375
<i>At the very least,</i>

149
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,545
<i>I'm happy we could preserve
his summer vacation intact.</i>

150
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,007
<i>Today's result,</i>

151
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,176
<i>Shirogane lost.</i>

152
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:34,180
<i>There's no way Shinomiya
would have a part-time job, right?</i>

153
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,183
<i>He might as well have invited me.</i>

154
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,774
Club activities are so worthless.

155
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,611
Club activities are important.

156
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,614
It helps you concentrate on something,
and it also develops your mind and body...

157
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,532
No.

158
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,659
I understand that clubs are important.

159
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:59,372
If there were no clubs, young people
would be free to indulge in mischief.

160
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,625
They would end up in protective custody,
suspension, having their families ruined.

161
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,420
In the end, people would end up
getting pregnant and start raising money.

162
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,423
Club activities have also become
a plausible reason

163
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,344
to keep emotionally immature children
away from all that.

164
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,638
I never said that.

165
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,307
However, that aspect of the clubs
is indeed a fact.

166
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,725
<i>Club activities.</i>

167
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,437
<i>There are two pyramids
at the Shuchiin Academy.</i>

168
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,399
<i>The first one is the pyramid
based on parentage.</i>

169
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,192
<i>At the Shuchiin Academy,</i>

170
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,735
<i>99 percent of the students</i>

171
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,822
{\an8}<i>are sons and daughters of wealthy people.</i>

172
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,865
{\an8}<i>That generates a power balance,</i>

173
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,910
{\an8}<i>which is called the lineage hierarchy.</i>

174
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,706
<i>Then there is this other pyramid.</i>

175
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,083
{\an8}<i>The caste of club activities.</i>

176
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,588
<i>Just by being part of a sports club,</i>

177
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,173
<i>you get really popular
regardless of your talent.</i>

178
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,676
<i>Compared to this absurdity,</i>

179
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,429
<i>people who aren't club members
or who are in cultural clubs</i>

180
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,223
<i>have a strong loser's complex
that it can't be put into words.</i>

181
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,684
I have no problem with people
who do it passionately.

182
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,437
But the majority are just pretending
to be involved in such clubs

183
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,273
in order to make friends.

184
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,318
Are they really that cold?

185
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,070
What are they enjoying?

186
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,865
They should be more serious about it.

187
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,867
Seriously...

188
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,202
Why don't they all just die?

189
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,579
<i>Damn it.</i>

190
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,290
<i>He started hating on the youngsters again.</i>

191
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>I need to bring the conversation
back to the point.</i>

192
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,630
Well, just let them be.

193
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,673
About the budget for the clubs.

194
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,469
{\an8}We are in an economic slump
and the donations have been declining.

195
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,639
{\an8}We need to cut from the budget
where we can.

196
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,433
I would like your opinion
as our accountant.

197
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,851
I see.

198
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,313
I will think about it as I did
as an accountant for my father's company.

199
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,566
I have to say that this budget covers
a lot of unnecessary things.

200
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,028
We should cut drastically
from the budget of the football club.

201
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,406
Okay. Why would we do that?

202
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,575
A lot of those people have girlfriends.

203
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,618
That's not a reason!

204
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,537
We could also cut the budgets
for basketball and baseball clubs

205
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,039
for the same reason.

206
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,458
Let's cut 50,000 yen for each couple.

207
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,542
That's a heavy tax!

208
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,337
Happiness should be the first thing
to be taxed.

209
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,130
The happiness tax.

210
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,966
Not even a tyrant would tax happiness.

211
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,843
You are totally holding a grudge.

212
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,595
Yes, I do.

213
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,431
But do you really consider it as evil?

214
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,017
<i>It's evil. It's really evil!</i>

215
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,520
You don't understand, President.

216
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,605
You don't get my feelings.

217
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,402
Hey, you don't have a match
next Sunday, right?

218
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,821
Let's go on a date.
It's been a while since our last.

219
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,198
I'm sorry,
I have practice on that day, too.

220
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,659
What? You have been practicing
all the time lately.

221
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,618
I'm sorry.

222
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,412
The championship is coming soon.

223
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,747
I understand that, but...

224
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,461
I am dedicating my life to football now.

225
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,213
That's cool!

226
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,676
Why are you crying?

227
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,429
I don't mind them having girlfriends.

228
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,598
After such a long time,
I don't feel anything about it anymore.

229
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,351
But if you have a girlfriend, date her!

230
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,395
Why are they training?

231
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,938
They have a precious girlfriend.

232
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,983
What could be more important
than a girlfriend?

233
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,904
I don't even have anything.

234
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,868
Hey, you are really good with computers.

235
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,412
Everybody says that to geeks.

236
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,540
Don't you want to join a club like that?

237
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,251
I don't think I could do that
as well as the student council.

238
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,671
Well, Shinomiya and Secretary Fujiwara
have their own clubs.

239
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,381
It's not like it's impossible.

240
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,176
Which clubs are they members of?

241
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,846
<i>Fujiwara is a member of board games club.</i>

242
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,474
<i>She looks like someone
who would enjoy that.</i>

243
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,480
<i>While Shinomiya is doing Japanese archery.</i>

244
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,981
<i>Japanese archery?</i>

245
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,484
That really suits her.

246
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,652
What do you mean?

247
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,571
When it comes to archery,

248
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,074
if you have large breasts,
sometimes they get caught in the string.

249
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:08,496
But if they're as big as Shinomiya's,
there won't be a problem at all.

250
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,914
Because they're just this big.

251
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,249
-Ishigami, behind you.
-It's just this big!

252
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,629
Ishigami! Ishigami!

253
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,464
Apparently, it's possible
to bind your breasts

254
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,090
and make them as large as a D cup.

255
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,177
Fujiwara's are definitely bigger
than that,

256
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,556
so the moment she would do archery,
they would float around a lot!

257
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,518
Like this!

258
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,020
Stop it, Ishigami!

259
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,563
Ishigami?

260
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,740
SMILE

261
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,203
PUNISH

262
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,916
I'm glad for you, Ishigami.

263
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,795
Fujiwara is kind,
so she will definitely forgive you.

264
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,215
But aside from Fujiwara,
no one will ever forgive you.

265
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,759
Do you understand?

266
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,681
President, I am going home
to write my will.

267
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,767
Oh, okay. But don't die.

268
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,315
Whether big ones or small ones,
I liked this life I have lived.

269
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,776
Did you both just come from your clubs?

270
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,819
Yes.

271
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:27,616
President, please raise the budget
of the board games club.

272
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,869
Don't try to bribe me so brazenly.

273
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,580
However, I've never been in a club,

274
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,665
so I can't understand how you feel.

275
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,417
Is that so?

276
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,546
<i>Then join...</i>

277
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,714
<i>No!</i>

278
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,840
<i>If I say that,</i>

279
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,343
<i>it would be like telling him
that I want us to be in the same club.</i>

280
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,846
<i>I... don't really...</i>

281
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,350
Then how about joining our club?

282
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,477
The board games club?

283
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,190
President, the culture clubs' budgets
won't be affected much.

284
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,651
If you want to inspect
the clubs as president,

285
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,572
you should enter a sports club where
the budget will suffer the biggest change.

286
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,532
No, our club is different!

287
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,702
We always buy new board games,
so we need a lot of budget.

288
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,912
What is that?

289
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,331
Come! Join my club!

290
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,792
No! You can't do that, no.

291
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:24,381
<i>Well, I have a part-time job,
so I don't have time to join a club.</i>

292
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,428
<i>But this situation
is making me feel very nice and popular.</i>

293
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,804
<i>I'll let them carry on a while.</i>

294
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,642
<i>Today's result,</i>

295
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,809
<i>Shirogane won.</i>

296
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,811
BECAUSE FOR A SHORT WHILE,
HE COULD ABLE TO FEEL HE HAS A HAREM

297
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,857
I WANT TO BE POPULAR PSYCHOANALYSIS ROAD

298
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,906
Then Pes got my dad's shoe
and ran away with it!

299
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:53,369
{\an8}Then my dad yelled at him, and said,
"I am not a bread from Shizuoka!"

300
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,121
{\an8}I laughed so hard
that my tummy hurt afterwards.

301
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,092
I like to see you laugh, Kaguya.

302
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,594
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

303
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:15,099
Because you haven't smiled in a long time.

304
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,686
<i>In middle school,
they called you Kaguya, the Ice Princess.</i>

305
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,271
<i>It seemed like you
were from another world.</i>

306
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,440
<i>There was a time like that, right?</i>

307
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,859
When you joined the Student Council,

308
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,029
you had a bad relationship
with the president for a while.

309
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,658
Shirogane, don't look at me.

310
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,536
What? You looked at me first.

311
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,580
<i>It was like being on a bed of nails.</i>

312
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,043
There were times like that, weren't there?

313
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,047
<i>People were afraid of me
and kept their distance,</i>

314
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,175
<i>but Fujiwara was the only one
who stayed by my side.</i>

315
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,556
<i>I should cherish her a little more.</i>

316
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:02,104
It's my dream to see you roaring
with laughter someday.

317
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,025
I wouldn't lose control
of myself like that.

318
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,860
That's what you say now.

319
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:12,114
I'm sure you would have laughed
if you had seen my dog Pes.

320
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,741
It's amazing!

321
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,325
Pes's wiener.

322
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,664
Is something wrong, Kaguya?

323
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,084
I understand.
You mean the dog's trick, right?

324
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,129
That he was playing
with a hot dog, a wiener.

325
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,048
I understand perfectly!

326
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,343
-<i>But I am surprised to hear this word...</i>
-Like when Pes puts his paw in my hand.

327
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,971
-<i>...from a nice girl like you.</i>
-I know it's kind of normal,

328
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,098
but his wiener is really weird!

329
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,143
How should I put it?

330
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,729
His wiener is awfully inclined
to the left.

331
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,357
Kaguya?

332
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,569
Sorry, I choked from the tea.

333
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,821
Oh! What's this?

334
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,657
Why can't I stop laughing
every time I hear the word "wiener"?

335
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,284
<i>Dirty jokes!</i>

336
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,661
<i>So far, Kaguya learned from her mistakes</i>

337
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,122
<i>and started educating herself about sex.</i>

338
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,207
<i>However,</i>

339
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,168
<i>when it comes to slang and metaphors
that aren't in the textbook,</i>

340
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,254
<i>she still has the knowledge level
of a middle schooler.</i>

341
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,381
Pes is quite sneaky.

342
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,886
When he sees food, his wiener gets big.
But the rest of the time, it's small.

343
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,349
<i>In short, Kaguya is at that phase</i>

344
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,559
<i>where kids laugh about words
like wiener and boobies.</i>

345
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,563
<i>Everyone was once that way,
but Kaguya is still catching up!</i>

346
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,650
Kaguya?

347
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,443
Please stop.

348
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,989
<i>If someone sees that I am laughing
about a vulgar word,</i>

349
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,825
<i>it would shame
the Shinomiya family forever.</i>

350
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,993
It's my dream to see you roaring
with laughter someday.

351
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,079
<i>It's too awful
that her dreams will come true</i>

352
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,664
<i>just by saying the word "wiener."</i>

353
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,543
<i>I have to reset my mood this instant!</i>

354
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,006
Are you...

355
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,886
Wiener.

356
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,730
Wiener.

357
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,191
Please stop.

358
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,693
I'm begging you.

359
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:16,530
You are roaring with laughter, Kaguya.

360
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,157
I am so happy!

361
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,159
<i>Fujiwara's dream came true.</i>

362
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,079
Fujiwara, you will stop now, won't you?

363
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,706
<i>There's no way she's stopping now.</i>

364
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,084
<i>Just like a parent
who wouldn't stop tickling their child</i>

365
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,004
<i>when they ask them to.</i>

366
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,340
<i>There is no way
the overjoyed Fujiwara would stop.</i>

367
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,050
<i>This is fun!</i>

368
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,761
<i>President?</i>

369
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,348
Hello.

370
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,600
President.

371
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,602
Now, be good, Fujiwara.

372
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,897
Don't you dare say it in front of a boy.

373
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,941
<i>She doesn't look like she wants to stop.</i>

374
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,776
It's all right.

375
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,236
I am a young lady.

376
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,864
I won't say such a word in front of boys.

377
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,992
Not from my mouth, at least.

378
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,912
<i>No! There's a hidden meaning
behind those words.</i>

379
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,247
Hey, President.

380
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,667
What is the breed of the dog
that looks like a sausage?

381
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,002
A sausage?

382
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,171
<i>A wiener sausage?</i>

383
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,341
<i>She wants to make him say "wiener!"</i>

384
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,093
<i>If I heard that word from the president,</i>

385
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,472
<i>I would definitely laugh!</i>

386
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,475
-<i>I can't let her make him say that.</i>
-There was another strange name for it.

387
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,518
<i>I need to change the topic,</i>

388
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,728
<i>Think.</i>

389
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,106
<i>Concentrate and use your brain,
Kaguya Shinomiya!</i>

390
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,778
-That's right, wiener...
-Sausage!

391
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,615
That's what you call it in English.

392
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,205
-What do you call a Frankfurt sausage?
-Wie...

393
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,122
A link!

394
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,583
That's how they call it
in the Kansai prefecture.

395
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,543
How about "cheers" in Italian?

396
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,962
-Wie...
-<i>Salut</i>!

397
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,590
It usually meant "health,"
but now people say it when toasting.

398
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,260
What else is there?

399
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,719
I can't think of anything!

400
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,264
What is it? What's up?

401
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,515
<i>I stopped her!</i>

402
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,519
<i>Now, I don't have to hear
the word "wiener" from his mouth.</i>

403
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,437
<i>I escaped trouble.</i>

404
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,318
Damn it! I wanted you to say "wiener!"

405
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,739
I couldn't do it
because Kaguya was interfering!

406
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,574
Are you a pervert?

407
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,785
I would never say that here.

408
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,620
Just what were you thinking?

409
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,165
Are you nymphomaniacs?

410
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,751
You really are nymphomaniacs!

411
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:38,297
I am not like that, you know!

412
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,220
Why... Why did it come to this?

413
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,474
Wiener.

414
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,893
Please stop!

415
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,604
It's too funny!

416
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,648
Don't say "wiener" anymore!

417
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,609
Fujiwara, how many times
do you have to say that to be satisfied?

418
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,112
Don't harass me anymore!

419
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,324
-It's because you react so funnily...
-<i>There's something unspeakable happening.</i>

420
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,367
Do you want to try saying it?

421
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,995
I would never say such a dirty word!

422
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,123
You've already said it many times!

423
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,833
One time, two times, it's all the same!

424
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,917
No!

425
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,044
Wiener.

426
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,588
Wiener.

427
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,256
<i>Today's result,</i>

428
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,091
<i>Fujiwara won.</i>

429
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,718
Wiener.

430
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,847
Do you have one?

431
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,437
