1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:02,210
CONFESSION

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,381
-<i>When you fall in love with someone...</i>
-Will you...

3
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,632
go out with me?

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,926
<i>You confess your love...</i>

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,014
<i>and it'll be accepted.</i>

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,227
<i>Anyone would tell you
that it's a wonderful thing,</i>

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,397
<i>but everything is wrong about that!</i>

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>Even between lovers,
there is always a clear power struggle.</i>

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>There is the one who exploits
and the one who is being exploited.</i>

10
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,573
<i>One who crushes and one who gets crushed.</i>

11
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,825
<i>There's always a winner and a loser.</i>

12
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,747
<i>You're saying
you want to live an honorable life,</i>

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,790
<i>then you should,
by no means, not become the loser.</i>

14
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>Love is a war!</i>

15
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>The moment you fall in love, you lose.</i>

16
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,399
<i>The private Shuchiin Academy.</i>

17
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,735
<i>This prestigious school,
with its ancient and noble origin,</i>

18
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,613
<i>was founded to educate the pupils
born in the upper crust of the society.</i>

19
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,158
<i>Even though that the nobility class system
has been abolished,</i>

20
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,701
<i>students from distinguished families,</i>

21
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,746
<i>who will, one day, rule the country
continues to attend this academy.</i>

22
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,125
Coming up next,
a message from the student council.

23
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,878
The members of the Student Council!

24
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,213
<i>Of course, they wouldn't let
these students to be led</i>

25
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,340
<i>by normal, ordinary people.</i>

26
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,678
<i>Kaguya Shinomiya,
the vice-president of the Student Council.</i>

27
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,805
<i>Total assets, two hundred trillion yen.</i>

28
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,765
<i>Being the eldest daughter
of the Shinomiya Group,</i>

29
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,853
<i>who owns more than a 1,000 subsidiaries,
and four industrial groups.</i>

30
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,397
<i>She is definitely a genuine young woman.</i>

31
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,025
<i>Just like the superiority
of her bloodline,</i>

32
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,776
<i>she is, undoubtedly,
a talented young woman.</i>

33
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,697
<i>With having such brilliant talents
in arts, music, and martial arts.</i>

34
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>She is Kaguya Shinomiya.</i>

35
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,952
<i>Meanwhile, the man
supporting Shinomiya is...</i>

36
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,666
<i>Miyuki Shirogane,
the president of the Student Council.</i>

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,585
<i>Sincere, vigorous,
sensible, and intelligent,</i>

38
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,670
<i>he always ranks number one
in the mock examinations.</i>

39
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,672
<i>In contrast to the talented Kaguya,</i>

40
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,008
<i>he earns respect and awe
as an experienced scholar.</i>

41
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,260
<i>Due to his exemplary conduct,</i>

42
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,929
<i>even he just transferred to the school,</i>

43
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,431
<i>he was selected to be the president
of the Student Council.</i>

44
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,477
<i>He, then, gets to wear
the pure gold braided cord</i>

45
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,188
<i>that has been passed down
through generations for 200 years.</i>

46
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,357
That is all.

47
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,074
They always look so splendid.

48
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:05,411
When they are together,
they look even more noble and graceful.

49
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,789
I wonder if they are dating.

50
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:11,209
Oh, no! If that were true,
it would be such a shock.

51
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,672
I wonder what they always talk
about in the student council room.

52
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,676
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

53
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,219
President!

54
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,930
Did you suddenly buy a smartphone?

55
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,058
{\an8}I even have the LINE application.

56
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,519
{\an8}Then let's exchange usernames.

57
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,854
<i>We are living in the IT era.</i>

58
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,858
<i>Even the stubborn and cheap Shirogane
who long proclaimed they were useless</i>

59
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,777
<i>finally got off his backside.</i>

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,279
<i>There's no need to explain</i>

61
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,947
<i>-how useful smartphones are...</i>
-I love it.

62
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,741
<i>-...for a high school student.</i>
-It's so useful and wonderful!

63
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,369
<i>Arranging to meet people
or making small talk on the phone,</i>

64
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,205
<i>worrying or being happy
while waiting for replies,</i>

65
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,708
<i>you can even confess your love on LINE!</i>

66
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,043
<i>It was because he didn't have LINE</i>

67
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,379
<i>that half of his year was wasted.</i>

68
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,216
<i>Well, now, you can come and ask
my username anytime now, Shinomiya!</i>

69
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,761
Yes, I have your username now.

70
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,641
<i>Why isn't she asking me?
This is my personal information.</i>

71
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,020
<i>Never mind. Should I just tell her myself?</i>

72
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,104
<i>But...</i>

73
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,939
<i>asking for contact information from girls.</i>

74
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,191
<i>One can read your desperation
and hidden desires</i>

75
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,443
<i>in this kind of behavior</i>

76
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,403
<i>and it gets a special meaning.</i>

77
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,032
<i>A meaning, or in other words, love.</i>

78
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:28,411
<i>The absolute rule of romantic relations
is that the person to fall in love loses.</i>

79
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,122
<i>The one who admits being in love
concedes defeat.</i>

80
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,041
<i>Asking for
the contact information of a girl</i>

81
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,376
<i>is the same as confessing your love.</i>

82
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,337
The President seems to like
the Vice President.

83
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,423
Really? Tell me more.

84
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,552
<i>That's like a death sentence
for boys at puberty.</i>

85
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,220
<i>I absolutely can't do it.</i>

86
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,972
<i>It's impossible for me to ask her.</i>

87
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,475
<i>Shinomiya, come and ask me.</i>

88
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,559
<i>President,</i>

89
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,395
<i>are you waiting for me
to come and ask you?</i>

90
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,064
<i>That's completely impossible.</i>

91
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,273
<i>For a girl like me</i>

92
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:01,944
<i>to ask you while being embarrassed
would mean something, right?</i>

93
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,655
<i>Fight! This is inevitable in the world.</i>

94
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,074
<i>To kill or be killed?</i>

95
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,075
<i>-Your ID?
-Your ID?</i>

96
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,701
<i>To ask or be asked?</i>

97
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,705
<i>It's not too much to say that this decides
the superiority among humans.</i>

98
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,957
<i>Good grief.</i>

99
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:20,797
<i>How much trouble do you think I went to
just to make him get a smartphone?</i>

100
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,343
<i>With this, I can finally contact him
outside of school.</i>

101
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,679
<i>You could say that the plan
worked for the most part.</i>

102
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,598
<i>I see.</i>

103
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,893
<i>In the end, she wants me to ask her,
as I am the man.</i>

104
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,229
<i>If that's the way she wants it...</i>

105
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,484
Oh, President, what's this profile photo?

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,654
Oh, it's a picture of me as a child.

107
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,447
It's cute!

108
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,699
Even then you already had a bad boy look.

109
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,494
-<i>A picture of him as a kid?</i>
-it was like a warning.

110
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,246
But this is a little embarrassing.

111
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,623
-<i>I don't really...</i>
-I should change it with another picture.

112
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,292
I will change it in three minutes.

113
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,627
<i>What's this?</i>

114
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,171
<i>If he changes his profile picture already,</i>

115
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,882
<i>I won't be able to see
the current one anymore.</i>

116
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,176
<i>But to ask him for his contact information</i>

117
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,011
<i>would be the same as telling him,</i>

118
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,347
<i>"I want to be able
to speak with you anytime!"</i>

119
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,598
<i>Then that's the same as</i>

120
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:17,103
<i>saying I want to write to you just before
I fall asleep the night before a test,</i>

121
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,398
<i>sending messages one after another
and chatting idly for a long time.</i>

122
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,652
<i>It's not like I'm thinking
about that kind of things at all!</i>

123
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:25,945
<i>For a lady,</i>

124
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,947
<i>it's impossible to act so improper</i>

125
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,199
<i>and ask for the contact information
of a man!</i>

126
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,119
<i>I have no choice but to use my trump card.</i>

127
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,624
Kaguya?

128
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,840
President, you're a terrible person.

129
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,429
Why did you do such a horrible thing?

130
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,766
<i>Cheating skill, engaged!</i>

131
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,352
<i>It's so terrible, President!</i>

132
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,439
-It's terrible!
<i>-This doesn't mean anything in particular,</i>

133
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:05,651
<i>but if someone tells you you're horrible,
you start feeling that you did something.</i>

134
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,362
<i>In terms of psychology,
this is called the Barnum effect.</i>

135
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,449
I'm sorry,
I didn't make you feel left out.

136
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,161
Look, I'm showing it to you, too.
Look at it!

137
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,120
It's too late.

138
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,788
<i>Absolute memory!</i>

139
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,789
<i>In a split second,</i>

140
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,335
<i>Kaguya saved Shirogane's profile
pictures in her hippocampus.</i>

141
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,506
<i>Shirogane lost his single secret weapon!</i>

142
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,717
<i>Kaguya makes an overwhelming,
superior comeback!</i>

143
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,890
<i>All right, now there is no reason for me
to ask the President's username.</i>

144
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,143
<i>Now, go ahead and ask me politely.</i>

145
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,897
<i>Something, I have to do something.</i>

146
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,484
<i>Shirogane is looking for a way out of it.</i>

147
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,277
<i>I have to do it.</i>

148
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,113
<i>Kaguya is thinking of a way
to force it out of him.</i>

149
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,866
<i>-There it is!
-The end is before her eyes!</i>

150
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,910
That's right!

151
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,371
To be talking about LINE
in front of Kaguya,

152
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,622
who has an old Japanese phone,

153
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,749
it's so terrible.

154
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,335
I am sorry!

155
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,628
It can't use it?

156
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,672
You're rich, you should replace it
with a new one!

157
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,633
It's the same phone I've been using
since kindergarten. I'm attached to it!

158
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,801
I won't replace this one.

159
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,761
-Give up on your weird fixations!
<i>-This story...</i>

160
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,555
-How is this weird?
<i>-...is about love and wit</i>

161
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,890
<i>of people who keep going in circles.</i>

162
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,811
WE EXCHANGED MAIL ADDRESSES

163
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,398
It's cold today.

164
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,483
{\an8}I wonder if summer can't come sooner.

165
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,070
{\an8}You are pretty hasty.
There's still plenty of spring left.

166
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,029
No!

167
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,115
Time goes by really fast.

168
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,866
If you're careless,

169
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,368

00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,287
{\an8}80 PERCENT DAMAGE TO SHINOMIYA
AND SHIROGANE

171
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,000
When summer comes, let's take a trip
with everyone from the Student Council.

172
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,835
That would be nice.

173
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,421
Let's go somewhere with friends.

174
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:50,923
<i>A trip, eh?</i>

175
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,009
<i>It would be nice to go to the mountains.</i>

176
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,345
<i>The refreshing air,</i>

177
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,390
<i>the echoes,</i>

178
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,940
<i>renting a cottage and having a barbeque,</i>

179
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,900
<i>and then at night,</i>

180
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,278
<i>we'll be caught in the magic
of the night sky.</i>

181
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,529
Look!

182
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,950
That's the summer triangle,
the Deneb, Altair, and Vega stars.

183
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,954
Altair and Vega are the shepherd
and the weaver of Japanese legends.

184
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,832
They're just like us, then.

185
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,584
So close...

186
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,420
and yet so far away from each other.

187
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,388
I don't like it!

188
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:44,018
I want to be the B Centauri star
to your A Centauri!

189
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,687
Please let me revolutionize
the heaven with you!

190
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,399
My, my.

191
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,069
What an exceptional, spoiled little star!

192
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,904
<i>This is it!</i>

193
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,697
<i>This is only possible in the mountains!</i>

194
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,700
That's true, if we went...

195
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,077
It would have to be to the sea.

196
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,372
<i>Sea versus mountains!</i>

197
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,000
<i>A resolute battle fought
since ancient times!</i>

198
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,128
<i>The curtain rises for a battle of strong
thought patterns of human beings.</i>

199
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,299
<i>The sea, the origin of life.</i>

200
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,510
<i>The sun setting down again and again
returns people</i>

201
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,387
<i>to being animals that rely on instinct.</i>

202
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,935
<i>I would bewitch the president
in my bathing suit right away!</i>

203
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:34,485
<i>The president trapped in the sea's magic
would confess his love to me at sunset.</i>

204
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,780
<i>Perfect.</i>

205
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,909
The sound of the sea roaring
is the best lullaby.

206
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,745
The salty sea breeze
would blow out the summer's heat, right?

207
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,746
<i>The sea?</i>

208
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,706
<i>Anything but the sea.</i>

209
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,542
<i>I don't know how to swim!</i>

210
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,214
<i>Maybe if I used a tube in the sea...</i>

211
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,967
President, are you a bad swimmer?

212
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,178
How cute of you!

213
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,305
<i>No way! It has to be the mountains!</i>

214
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,015
<i>Who would want to go to the sea?</i>

215
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,809
There are a lot of people on the beach,

216
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,352
and the sand is sticky.

217
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,106
Let's use the private beach
of the Shinomiya Group.

218
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,400
There are showers
and thermal baths installed there.

219
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,694
Sunburns are the maiden's greatest enemy!

220
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,530
Then let's use the best sunscreen lotion.

221
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,284
We can call the best aesthetician
to take perfect care of our skin.

222
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,702
There are sharks.

223
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,955
Let's invite the best
shark hunter from Florida.

224
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,665
We could have a shark fin for dinner.

225
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,543
<i>Damn it. These rich people!</i>

226
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,337
<i>You're sweet, President!</i>

227
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,758
<i>I already prepared a manual
in case you opposed this idea.</i>

228
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,511
<i>No matter what you bring up,
I can counter it.</i>

229
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,639
You can only go to the sea
during summer, right?

230
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,641
In the mountains,
the weather changes easily

231
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,893
and it can also rain.

232
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,604
There are also a lot of insects.

233
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,481
<i>Insects?</i>

234
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,399
<i>Flies! Mosquitos!</i>

235
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,692
<i>Anything but insects...</i>

236
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,988
<i>I can stand anything but insects!</i>

237
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,782
<i>What should I do?</i>

238
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,326
<i>If I go to the sea, I can't swim.</i>

239
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,244
<i>If I go to the mountains,
there are insects!</i>

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,210
Should I buy a bathing suit?

241
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,252
<i>I won!</i>

242
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,087
Oh, that's right!

243
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,132
Last year's bathing suit
doesn't fit me anymore,

244
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,009
so I have to buy a new one.

245
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,815
Shinomiya is confident about her figure,

246
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,444
but remove that from her,
her attack power becomes weak,

247
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,780
like that of a peashooter.

248
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,034
If you compare that
with the Fujiwara's tank,

249
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,994
the difference in power is quite a gap.

250
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,413
That's bad! Never mind
about bewitching the president.

251
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,209
What are those?

252
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,046
What should we call Shinomiya
in comparison to that?

253
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,132
A childish chest?

254
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,929
Let's go to the mountains.

255
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,766
At sea, the sand sticks to you,
there are a lot of people and even sharks.

256
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,102
-The mountains are better.
-That's not what you said.

257
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,228
No, the sea is better.

258
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,397
In the mountains, it rains,
and there are many insects.

259
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,107
-Let's go to the sea.
-I think so, too!

260
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,692
-To the mountains!
-The sea!

261
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,027
-Mountains!
-Sea!

262
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,864
If we'll be like this,
let's let Fujiwara decide for us.

263
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,366
-What, me?
-Yes, let's do that.

264
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,035
Let's go to the sea, okay?
Do you understand?

265
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,289
To the mountains!
You won't betray me, right?

266
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,335
If I have to pick one...

267
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,546
it would be the mountains.

268
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,547
Yes!

269
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,508
Oh, mountains are fine,

270
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,095
but I would like to go
to the scary mountain.

271
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,763
-The scary mountain?
-The scary mountain?

272
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,227
To the children's limbo,
at the pool of blood in hell,

273
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,688
with many windmills rotating
the cycle of death and rebirth.

274
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:02,067
If we go all that way, we could have a
blind medium summon a spirit of the dead.

275
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,194
Who should it be?

276
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,948
-Well, we can think about it in summer.
-Christ? Buddha? Prince Shotoku's fine.

277
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,159
-Aristotle? Shakespeare?
-That's right.

278
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,203
-Cleopatra? Einstein? Hideyoshi Toyotomi?
-<i>Today's result,</i>

279
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,039
-Gandhi? Sen no Rikyu?
<i>-It came to nothing.</i>

280
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,957
Caesar? Marie Antoinette?

281
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,876
Oscar François de Jarjayes?

282
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,713
FUJIWARA CHIKA

283
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,215
Love advice?

284
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,762
Yes, I'm asking you, the renowned winner
of a hundred love battles.

285
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,806
{\an8}I thought you could surely give me
some good advice.

286
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,603
I understand.

287
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,981
I'll see what I can do.

288
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,107
President!

289
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,985
<i>The battle of a hundred love battles?</i>

290
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,655
<i>When did I get such an image?</i>

291
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,283
<i>Shirogane Miyuki, 17 years old.
Romantic experience,</i>

292
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,201
<i>none.</i>

293
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,411
<i>What?</i>

294
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,664
<i>If I give him a really bad advice...</i>

295
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,666
The president was a virgin.

296
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,292
A virgin?

297
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,961
What a disappointment!

298
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,381
Shinomiya!

299
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,424
How cute of you.

300
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,426
<i>Damn it!
I just have to get through it somehow.</i>

301
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,846
Leave romance to me!

302
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,392
I have never been rejected in my life!

303
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,726
As expected of you, President!

304
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,562
<i>Since he's never confessed,
it's not a lie.</i>

305
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,982
<i>The president is giving romantic advice?</i>

306
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,443
<i>This is my chance to find out
how he feels about romantic things.</i>

307
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,154
Then, what do you need advice on?

308
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:33,033
There is this girl in my class, Kashiwagi.

309
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,286
I was thinking of telling her
that I like her.

310
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,833
But when I think she might reject me,

311
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,586
I thought it might be best to observe
our relationship a little longer.

312
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,382
By the way, are you in contact with her?

313
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,884
She gave me chocolates
last Valentine's Day.

314
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,511
What kind of chocolate?

315
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,431
Choco balls, three of them.

316
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,767
Those are obligatory chocolates, right?

317
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,020
<i>That's nothing else but obligation.</i>

318
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,481
That is...

319
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,610
-She is surely in love with you.
<i>-What?</i>

320
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,029
<i>Just because of the choco balls?</i>

321
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,030
Listen!

322
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,490
Women are not honest about their feelings.

323
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,702
They always do the opposite
of what they feel.

324
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,121
In other words, even the chocolates
that seem obligatory...

325
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,873
Does that mean that she likes me?

326
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,166
<i>What do you mean, the opposite?</i>

327
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,213
<i>-Okay, I said something appropriate.</i>
-But I don't think she is like that.

328
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,882
A few days ago...

329
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,428
Hey, do you have a girlfriend
or someone like that?

330
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,139
I don't, but...

331
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,141
Just as I thought.

332
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,143
He says he doesn't have a girlfriend!

333
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,353
He doesn't look like he has one, though.

334
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,563
That's so funny!

335
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,820
So I thought
she was just making fun of me.

336
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,907
<i>It's too bad, but they were actually
making fun of him.</i>

337
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,285
<i>The way the opposite sex views you
has been really a problem.</i>

338
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,536
You.

339
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,372
You're at your bloom.

340
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,251
Why are you doubting women so much?

341
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,754
They are human beings just like you.

342
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,340
<i>-That's not what he said earlier!</i>
-Here's how to understand them.

343
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,719
Hey, do you have a girlfriend
or someone like that?

344
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,180
<i>If you don't, I would like to date you.</i>

345
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,016
I don't, but...

346
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,226
Just as I thought!

347
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,978
<i>You are tied to me by destiny!</i>

348
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,730
He said he doesn't have a girlfriend.

349
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,565
He doesn't look like he has one, though.

350
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,442
<i>Because he's too noble for that!</i>

351
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,111
That's so funny!

352
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,029
<i>I am so happy that he's single!</i>

353
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,116
<i>I am just the right one for him.</i>

354
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,034
<i>Isn't he seeing this too positively?</i>

355
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,746
How stupid of me.

356
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,872
<i>Exactly!</i>

357
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,584
I just had to choose only one of them.

358
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,294
<i>You are the stupid one!</i>

359
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,590
Wouldn't that cause
a rift in their friendship?

360
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,969
Worst comes to worst,
it might result to bullying.

361
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,847
That is how female friendships are.

362
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,849
<i>What's with this
condescending conversation?</i>

363
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,725
But it's all right.

364
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,686
She has you.

365
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,646
She's yours to protect.

366
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:12,067
It's my job to protect her.

367
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,944
President!

368
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,445
<i>What's this?</i>

369
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,865
But it's my first time
confessing to a girl.

370
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,950
How do you do that?

371
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,451
I have a good idea!

372
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,081
If the aforementioned girl were here...

373
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,040
Yes.

374
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,334
Then you go like this...

375
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,840
Go out with me.

376
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,510
And then,

377
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,222
you crush her against the wall
and she will grow anxious,

378
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,433
but as soon as you whisper
your love in her ears,

379
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,061
her anxiousness will turn into palpitation
and your chance to succeed will be bigger.

380
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,230
<i>Oh, that scared me.</i>

381
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,523
I call this technique...

382
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,609
"Walls down."

383
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,485
I gave the name for it.

384
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,113
<i>That's already a thing!
It's called "wall slamming."</i>

385
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,781
A... genius?

386
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,450
<i>You ignorant fool!</i>

387
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,951
Thank you very much!

388
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,245
Thanks to you I have the courage now.

389
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,415
After all, the "Walls down"
worked perfectly with Shinomiya.

390
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,420
No, I am not dating Shinomiya.

391
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,673
<i>That's right. I haven't been taken down.</i>

392
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,008
Is that so?

393
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,636
From afar, you look good together.

394
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,179
No, it's the exact opposite.

395
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,183
Lately, I feel like she hates me.

396
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,936
She seems to not be
interested in me at all.

397
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,064
<i>What? I don't really hate him.</i>

398
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,899
<i>Did I do something?</i>

399
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,234
<i>No self-awareness.</i>

400
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,279
President, the important thing
is what you feel for Shinomiya!

401
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,744
What do I feel for Shinomiya?

402
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:53,543
Well, honestly, she's a rich genius,
so she's annoying sometimes.

403
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:58,215
She's surprisingly careless,
looks scary, and her breasts are also...

404
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,927
But maybe all these are good qualities.

405
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,929
In fact, she's cool!

406
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,515
She's beautiful,
and ladylike, and graceful.

407
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,518
Moreover, she's smart and perfect!

408
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,855
Shinomiya is really the best woman!

409
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,196
<i>She's really there. I'm glad I noticed.</i>

410
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,866
Anyway, if you don't confess,
nothing will happen.

411
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,745
If you keep thinking of weird strategies
and tactics, nothing good will happen.

412
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,499
<i>What is this?
Saying this feels kind of right.</i>

413
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,794
I... I will try my best.

414
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,465
Thank you very much.

415
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,973
Kaguya?

416
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,684
Did something good happen?

417
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,061
No, nothing at all.

418
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,897
<i>A little while later...</i>

419
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,194
<i>He confessed to Kashiwagi</i>

420
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,780
<i>and it seems like they are dating now.</i>

421
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,829
President, I made tea for you.

422
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,623
Oh, thank you.

423
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,127
<i>Her mood seems to have improved.
I'm really glad.</i>

424
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
<i>-Today's results...</i>
-Are you happy about something?

425
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,091
-No, I'm the same as usual.
<i>-Shirogane isn't particularly responsible</i>

426
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,302
<i>why Kaguya went from being mad
and then fine,</i>

427
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,471
<i>but he wasted all his efforts,
so Shirogane lost today.</i>

428
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,681
