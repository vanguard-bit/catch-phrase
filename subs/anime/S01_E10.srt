1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:02,544
<i>Shuraba.</i>

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:07,090
<i>In Indian mythology, this is the place
where Asura fought Indra.</i>

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,635
<i>But today, it has two main meanings.</i>

4
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:14,347
<i>First, the cramming before a deadline.</i>

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:20,603
<i>Second, the scene of trouble
between two people.</i>

6
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,074
Please eat it.

7
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,077
Are you kidding? You should eat it.

8
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,790
<i>It's my fault.</i>

9
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>If only I hadn't eaten it.</i>

10
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,753
<i>In order to explain this situation,</i>

11
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,381
<i>I have to talk about two other incidents.</i>

12
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,674
THE VISIT TO KAGUYA'S HOME

13
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:17,595
<i>Shirogane climbed into bed
while Kaguya was half-conscious.</i>

14
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,389
<i>As a result, they slept</i>

15
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,182
<i>lying next to each other
for several hours.</i>

16
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,976
<i>When Kaguya woke up,</i>

17
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,311
<i>she was understandably confused
and enraged.</i>

18
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,105
<i>But the on-the-spot investigation</i>

19
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,691
<i>proved Shirogane's innocence.</i>

20
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,442
<i>In the end, they reacted like adults.</i>

21
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,819
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

22
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,237
No, I'm sorry.

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,198
<i>They formally reconciled.</i>

24
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,284
<i>But the grudge remained.</i>

25
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:43,163
<i>From Kaguya's point of view,
he used her weakness while she was sick</i>

26
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,789
<i>to get into bed with her.</i>

27
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,667
<i>Was he more or less naughty with her?</i>

28
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,127
<i>That made her anxious.</i>

29
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,379
<i>If he wasn't...</i>

30
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,172
<i>Well, that would also make her angry.</i>

31
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,716
<i>This was her issue.</i>

32
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,595
<i>But Shirogane thought he also had a point
about being falsely accused.</i>

33
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,347
<i>She pulled him into bed</i>

34
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,810
<i>without knowing how hard it was for him
to endure and control himself.</i>

35
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,521
{\an8}<i>He was naturally irritated.</i>

36
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,983
<i>Especially since Shinomiya continues
to look at him with suspicion.</i>

37
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:16,654
<i>All this accumulated animosity
had to be released some way or another.</i>

38
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,114
THE CAKE INCIDENT

39
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,032
A WHILE EARLIER

40
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,658
What are these?

41
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,786
They're a gift from the principal.
You can eat them.

42
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,787
Great!

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,584
Is this all the cake left?

44
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,795
The principal wasn't really considerate.

45
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,715
He could at least consider
how many people are working here.

46
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:39,344
Well, that's because we're the only ones
working here before.

47
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,889
Don't worry about it and eat, Ishigami.

48
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,890
I don't really want it.

49
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,017
No, please eat it.

50
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,602
I don't really mind.

51
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,520
No, you eat it.

52
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,356
No, you eat it.

53
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,565
No, I mean it.

54
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,484
-No, you eat it.
-No, you eat it.

55
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,610
No, you eat it.

56
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,449
It's all right, so eat it.

57
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,785
You should eat it.

58
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,579
<i>This is how their frustration explodes.</i>

59
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,874
Girls like this,
so you don't need to hold back.

60
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,253
-You also like sweets, right?
<i>-The beautiful spirit of compromise!</i>

61
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,004
Look, it's getting cold as we speak.

62
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,131
-Right. It's also time to go home.
<i>-As time passed by,</i>

63
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,425
<i>-the situation changed.</i>
-It's too late for me to eat it.

64
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,677
So please eat it.

65
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,179
The longer you're holding on to it,
the more it will get mushy.

66
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,472
That's why, if you eat it now,

67
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,391
we would be able
to settle this peacefully.

68
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,685
You are a stubborn person.

69
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,561
It's all right, eat it.

70
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,854
You eat it.

71
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,357
There's no need
to be weird about it, right?

72
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,444
<i>After more than an hour,
nothing can still interfere in this fight,</i>

73
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,989
<i>as the scene transforms in an underworld
of deep resentment.</i>

74
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,367
-Even the cake wants you to eat it.
<i>-It's my fault.</i>

75
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,787
-Don't imply that a cake could talk.
<i>-If only I hadn't eaten it. This would...</i>

76
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,456
-Prove to me that the cake can't talk!
<i>-This is just getting worse.</i>

77
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,000
Without proof, that's just sophistry!

78
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,917
<i>That's right!</i>

79
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,377
<i>Fujiwara!</i>

80
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,132
<i>The only one who can stop them
is Fujiwara.</i>

81
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,261
Why are you so stubborn about eating it?

82
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,430
There should be a limit
to how stubborn someone can be.

83
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,182
Of course, you would know something
about being stubborn!

84
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,810
It's because of something
you once told me.

85
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,438
What do you think have I told you?

86
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,149
It was only after we started
on the Student Council.

87
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,695
Shinomiya, do you have any hobbies?

88
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,781
I don't. But how is that your business?

89
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,907
Not really.

90
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,662
You have such lifeless eyes, you know.

91
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,415
So I was wondering
if there was something you liked.

92
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,917
Something I liked?

93
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,379
Shortcake.

94
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,465
That's what you said!

95
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,633
I can't forget how your face looked
when you said that.

96
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,681
How can you still remember something
from a long time ago?

97
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,099
How could I forget it?

98
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,269
Really? Is that so?

99
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,271
My nose is a bit itchy,
so I will just scratch it.

100
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,898
Don't mind me.

101
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,691
Oh, scratch as much as you like!

102
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,074
<i>He remembers something
from such a long time ago.</i>

103
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,661
Since you said that,
I'll say something as well.

104
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,579
What?

105
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,414
At the end of last year.

106
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,920
How are you spending Christmas, President?

107
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,255
I'll be working.

108
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,217
Is that so? That's too bad.

109
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,426
Not really.

110
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,430
Christmas is just
another ordinary day for me.

111
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,894
On Christmas morning, my dad just gives me
a 20-dollar book gift certificate.

112
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,604
We don't particularly celebrate.

113
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,148
I've never eaten Christmas cake,

114
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,400
but I'm not really jealous.

115
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,572
I became a little sad
when I heard that story.

116
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,118
That's why I want you to eat
a lot of this cake

117
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,953
since you've never tasted it before!

118
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,624
Is that what you were thinking?

119
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,127
I see!

120
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,545
By the way, my forehead itches.

121
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,630
I'm scratching it a bit. Don't mind me.

122
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,590
Scratch it as much as you like!

123
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,346
That's enough!

124
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,849
Instead of being like this,
I have an idea.

125
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,476
Today, as an exception, I will feed you.

126
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,770
What? No, you won't.

127
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,398
I will feed you.

128
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,358
Don't steal my idea!

129
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,861
Hey, don't be shy and open your mouth!

130
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,696
You open your mouth!

131
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,907
-Open your mouth!
-Open your mouth!

132
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,202
-Open your mouth!
-Open your mouth!

133
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,079
We won't get anywhere this way.

134
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,248
I will eat after you.

135
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,708
No, you eat first.

136
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,334
After you eat, I will eat as well.

137
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,420
Okay, how about we eat at the same time?

138
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,588
Okay!

139
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,550
Let's start.

140
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,062
This is the friendship police!

141
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,523
Bad children who fight
will have to stop now!

142
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,029
Fighting isn't good.

143
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,574
If you can't get along,
I will confiscate the cake.

144
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:18,664
<i>Today's results,
Kaguya and Shirogane lost.</i>

145
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,877
WAR CRIMINAL

146
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,047
You need love advice?

147
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,175
{\an8}Well, instead of love advice,

148
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,345
{\an8}I need advice regarding boys.

149
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:36,766
Like, how to reconcile
with a boy you had a fight with?

150
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,394
I thought since you have a boyfriend,

151
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,898
you must have some useful thoughts.

152
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,158
Really? You're asking me for love advice?

153
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,203
Well, not really love,

154
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:01,457
but I wanted to talk about how to make up
with a girl you had a fight with.

155
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,628
I see. If that's about it, leave it to me.

156
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,964
Because I am the love expert.

157
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,090
Really?

158
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,466
I'm kidding.

159
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,592
You're kidding?

160
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,679
Well, I read a lot of romance manga.

161
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,056
Then it should be fine.

162
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,184
This is about a friend of mine.

163
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:26,232
If you start talking like that,
it will sound like the story is about you.

164
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,068
But you're not the type
who would do something so cliché.

165
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,237
Of course.

166
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,656
Then?

167
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:38,369
Then why did you fight with him?

168
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,496
Well...

169
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,207
This is about a friend of mine.

170
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,710
<i>It's definitely about her.</i>

171
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,422
A friend of mine caught a cold

172
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,425
and a boy came to visit her
while she was sick.

173
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,138
But while she was unconscious,

174
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,556
he...

175
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,475
well, slept beside her?

176
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,313
When she woke up, he was on her bed.

177
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,481
What? You can't do that!

178
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,441
That's shameless!

179
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,400
He's a monster!

180
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,902
Of course, nothing happened.

181
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,489
Besides, it's possible
that she invited him

182
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,409
while she was only half-conscious.

183
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,869
Even if that's true,

184
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:25,249
when a girl is vulnerable,
a guy should behave morally right!

185
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,419
That's right!
That's how you should look at it!

186
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,963
That boy has no morals!

187
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,591
Right?

188
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,969
Who is this stupid woman?

189
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,929
She's stupid. That's obvious and simple.

190
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,515
She invites you in herself
and then she dares to babble

191
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,267
that you're an idiot.

192
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,394
She has no morals, right?

193
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,189
They're absolutely a pain,
women like that.

194
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,108
If she's in a manga, she would be
a dark-haired, flat-chested woman.

195
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,195
-That's obvious.
<i>-Just one push and he keeps rolling.</i>

196
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,947
No matter how much she insists
that she wasn't conscious,

197
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,241
to pull a guy into bed,

198
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,869
that woman is definitely immoral.

199
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,163
At first, she seems pure and clean,
and acts so important,

200
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,333
but the way she expresses
her sexual desire is warped and selfish.

201
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,377
She acts as if she's not interested
in men,

202
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,545
but she eats a good man completely.

203
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,422
If men are wolves, women are snakes.

204
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,842
Before you know it, they're entangled
and eating their own tail, an ouroboros.

205
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,552
Oh, how I hate them.

206
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,429
I bet after the guy left, she touched...

207
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,098
Okay, you can stop now, Ishigami.

208
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:27,353
Well, he still shouldn't have let things
happen like that.

209
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:32,274
Even though there was probably
a gentler way to handle it, he didn't.

210
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,570
He probably didn't want
to handle it like that.

211
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,119
But in the end, they apologized
to each other for that incident,

212
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,495
so it's done.

213
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:48,999
However, he acts very normal
around her after that.

214
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,669
As if nothing happened.

215
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,380
Oh, I hate that.

216
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,841
When one side frets about it

217
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,884
and then the other one
doesn't even seem to care.

218
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,055
It's not like it was such
a light incident.

219
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,598
That's right.

220
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,102
That's why it's hard
not to be a little angry.

221
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,146
She can't help it, right?

222
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,355
That's right!

223
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,899
Since they slept together on a bed,

224
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,778
he should take responsibility
and at least confess his love for her!

225
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,321
That's right!

226
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,990
So he really is irresponsible?

227
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,741
Right?

228
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,161
Such an annoying idiot!

229
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
They apologized to each other, right?

230
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,373
If so, then that's the end of it!

231
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,459
What is she dragging it out for?

232
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,751
<i>He's loud.</i>

233
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,838
Just hearing about it, I get mad.

234
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,798
Should I go talk to her?

235
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,134
I would reject that stupid woman.

236
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,093
But...

237
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,970
that incident is settled now.

238
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:47,099
I didn't really think
that he should take responsibility for it.

239
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,393
Then what are you angry about?

240
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,022
What am I angry about?

241
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,233
You said he didn't lay a finger on you,

242
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,653
and if you don't want him
to take responsibility,

243
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,365
then what are you angry about?

244
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,286
I don't know.

245
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,204
What?

246
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,498
<i>There's no way I can say it.</i>

247
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,292
<i>To be honest, I wish he had touched me
even just for a bit or something.</i>

248
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,962
-<i>Am I really that unattractive?</i>
-I am sorry.

249
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,673
<i>How can I be angry
about something so stupid?</i>

250
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,134
<i>There's no way I can say it.</i>

251
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,513
There?

252
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,350
That's how a woman would get angry.

253
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,478
A man who tries
to understand women completely

254
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,438
is probably arrogant to begin with.

255
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,735
In the end, it's probably best
to wait for things to quiet down.

256
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,489
If the man has nothing
to feel guilty about,

257
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,824
there's really no need to apologize.

258
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,828
A guilty conscience?

259
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,182
Shinomiya, there is something
I have to tell you.

260
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,060
What is it?

261
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,731
I told you I didn't lay a finger on you.

262
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:18,899
But...

263
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,736
I did touch you once.

264
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,540
Where did you... touch me?

265
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,625
On your lips.

266
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,591
I just pressed my finger like this.

267
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,760
I didn't mean it in a weird way,
I was just being silly...

268
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,803
President.

269
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,975
Now we're even.

270
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,991
We will be back to normal
starting tomorrow, right?

271
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,097
<i>Today's result, they both won.</i>

272
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,851
PASSING BY

273
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,978
Look here!

274
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,314
The Student Council's work is done!

275
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,900
And the summer vacation starts tomorrow!

276
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,278
PICKING UP FLYERS

277
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,573
Shinomiya, do you have any plans
for this vacation?

278
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,410
Just to go shopping.

279
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,163
Will you be working all the time?

280
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,750
{\an8}No, the shift distribution
was lighter than I thought.

281
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,877
{\an8}I have a lot of free time.

282
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,338
I would like to do something.

283
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,548
It would be nice to do something.

284
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,133
-Right, Fujiwara?
-Right, Fujiwara?

285
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,221
<i>Summer vacation schedule.</i>

286
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,305
-Mountains.
-Sea.

287
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,598
The scary mountain!

288
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:19,561
<i>The pending problem
of the disputed summer vacation trip.</i>

289
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,981
<i>Whether this will result
in something or not</i>

290
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,609
<i>depends on this moment.</i>

291
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,278
<i>A lot of events are organized
during the summer vacation.</i>

292
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,615
<i>Whether they can be attended
by mixed groups of girls and boys</i>

293
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,076
<i>is the starting point
that everything else depends on.</i>

294
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,538
<i>If they went in a mixed group at first,
they would discuss where to go</i>

295
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,248
<i>and when to go next.</i>

296
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,000
<i>Thus, possibilities are born.</i>

297
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,627
<i>But if they start off on the wrong foot,</i>

298
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,380
<i>the psychological difficulty
of a mixed group will be bigger.</i>

299
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:51,844
<i>Then they will spend the summer vacation
in groups of boys or girls exclusively.</i>

300
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,848
{\an8}<i>If they failed at this,
it would be a bleak summer vacation!</i>

301
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,142
<i>This wouldn't happen!</i>

302
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,226
<i>This wouldn't happen!</i>

303
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,436
<i>This wouldn't happen!</i>

304
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,395
<i>This wouldn't happen!</i>

305
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,896
<i>This wouldn't happen!</i>

306
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,814
<i>This either!</i>

307
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,274
<i>Reality!</i>

308
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,735
<i>Reality!</i>

309
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,237
<i>A trip with Shinomiya.</i>

310
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,740
<i>Of course, I would want to go!</i>

311
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,077
<i>But if I started talking about a trip...</i>

312
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,832
Oh my, president! You feel the need
to bring up that old topic again?

313
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,085
That was just a temporary idea.

314
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,337
It's not something
we need to discuss again.

315
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,341
Don't tell me that you really want
to go on the trip.

316
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,344
Did you have high hopes for it?

317
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,138
How cute is that?

318
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,973
<i>That's what she'd say!</i>

319
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,392
<i>Hey, you were the one
who started talking about it.</i>

320
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,519
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

321
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,480
Secretary Fujiwara.

322
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,275
Summer vacation will be over
before we know it.

323
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,527
That's right.

324
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,697
That's why I want to spend it
doing things I can't normally do.

325
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,699
A trip would be wonderful!

326
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,700
<i>Yes, exactly!</i>

327
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,785
A trip.

328
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,705
Everyone needs time to get away
from the noise of the big city.

329
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,706
Yes!

330
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,583
-I am also...
<i>-This could work!</i>

331
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,502
...going to Hawaii for a week!

332
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,172
<i>You're a tramp!</i>

333
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,174
<i>You were the one talking about
how you want to go</i>

334
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,675
<i>on a trip with everyone!</i>

335
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,470
<i>How can you go to Hawaii all by yourself?</i>

336
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,679
<i>Shinomiya!</i>

337
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,432
<i>She's like your friend or something,
so do something about it!</i>

338
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,269
That's right. A trip would be nice.

339
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,732
<i>Kaguya understands the importance
of this part when planning a vacation.</i>

340
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,693
<i>But Kaguya has known Fujiwara
for a long time,</i>

341
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:36,406
<i>and knows that she never behaves
the way you would like her to.</i>

342
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,536
<i>That's why she's blank.
Her wishful heart is also blank.</i>

343
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,496
<i>Breathing is fun.</i>

344
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,289
<i>It's useless!</i>

345
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,667
<i>I don't feel any motivation from her.</i>

346
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,629
<i>Well, now that Fujiwara mentioned
a trip, it can't be helped.</i>

347
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:54,341
<i>It was hard to talk about a group trip
from the start.</i>

348
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,093
<i>At least we have that!</i>

349
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,804
<i>We could manage a day trip somewhere!</i>

350
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,305
<i>But...</i>

351
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,267
Going somewhere without Fujiwara?

352
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:07,813
In other words, you don't want
to have fun with anyone but me?

353
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,483
Oh, my. How cute is that?

354
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,527
<i>That's how it would end!</i>

355
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,738
<i>As I thought, we can't talk about a trip
without Fujiwara!</i>

356
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,366
-Aloha!
<i>-Couldn't she do something with us...</i>

357
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,201
<i>the week after her trip?</i>

358
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,452
Secretary Fujiwara.

359
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,664
It's nice to go abroad,
but traveling in Japan is also good.

360
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,499
There are many events in the summer too.

361
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,334
What are you saying?

362
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,838
The summer of the second year
is a crucial point for exams!

363
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,382
I don't have the time
to be distracted by having fun!

364
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,800
<i>This phony!</i>

365
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,386
Who are you to say that
when you're going on a trip to Hawaii?

366
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:43,140
That's exactly why I'm keeping a balance
between fun and study!

367
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,641
<i>Damn it, that's a fair argument.</i>

368
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,727
<i>President, it won't work.</i>

369
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,314
<i>It's useless to try to control Fujiwara.</i>

370
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,610
<i>In times like these,
I think of delicious things.</i>

371
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,777
<i>Damn it!</i>

372
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,573
<i>I thought I could finally
make Shinomiya mine, this summer!</i>

373
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,827
<i>How cute is that?</i>

374
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,330
<i>No matter what pattern I follow,
it always turns out like that.</i>

375
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,207
<i>Maybe it can't be helped.</i>

376
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,124
But...

377
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,919
I would like to form some nice memories
at least once.

378
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,920
<i>Ishigami?</i>

379
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,923
I am only in my first year
and you're all in your second year.

380
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,301
Next year, you'll be busy studying,
so we might not get this chance again.

381
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,264
Maybe we can only have fun
at least this year.

382
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,393
<i>Ishigami, you stopped to consider this?</i>

383
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,774
<i>That's true. Summer isn't only
about having fun with women.</i>

384
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,651
<i>Fooling around with guy friends,</i>

385
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,569
<i>that's also part of summer.</i>

386
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,781
Let's go, Ishigami.

387
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,575
There's a big festival
at the end of summer.

388
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,202
I'll treat you to an octopus dumpling.

389
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,286
Summer vacation?

390
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,080
Let's go!

391
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,831
<i>How about your crucial study time?</i>

392
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,086
That sounds so nice! Cotton candy!
Rifle range! Fireworks!

393
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,254
<i>Fireworks?</i>

394
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,881
<i>Fireworks with the president?</i>

395
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,716
<i>Great!</i>

396
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,720
The festival is on August 24.

397
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,472
If we're free, let's go.

398
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,266
That's right. Me too...

399
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,768
Oh, I can't go.

400
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,479
I'm going to a tomato festival in Spain
around that time.

401
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,231
<i>You stupid tramp!</i>

402
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,774
<i>How many trips are you going on?</i>

403
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,192
<i>Damn it! I was greedy!</i>

404
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,903
<i>-The collapse of the blank heart.
-I was greedy!</i>

405
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,947
Don't tell me you will still go?

406
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,494
You will all go without me
to the summer festival?

407
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,038
Would you do such an awful thing?

408
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,915
Of course, we're going.

409
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,003
You're also going to the tomato festival.

410
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:40,007
How can you want us to not go
when you will be having fun on your own?

411
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,471
You're awful, Ishigami!

412
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,348
You're stupid! And cold-blooded!

413
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,267
And your bangs are too long!

414
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,936
How could you, Ishigami!

415
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,481
I hope you burn your tongue
on octopus dumplings!

416
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,109
I did it again.

417
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,155
I'm also going home.

418
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,784
No, Ishigami.

419
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,619
You did the right thing.

420
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:14,958
<i>Today's result, everyone but Fujiwara won.</i>

421
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,961
<i>Then, let's meet there
at seven o'clock on that day.</i>

422
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,713
<i>Yes. I'm looking forward to it.</i>

423
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,923
<i>That was the start
of the summer vacation story</i>

424
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,134
<i>of a man and a woman.</i>

425
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,765
ENLARGED
I THOUGHT SO

426
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,104
