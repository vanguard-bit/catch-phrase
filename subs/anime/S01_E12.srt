00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,429
<i>Tonight...</i>

2
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>Tonight, we're going
to the fireworks festival.</i>

3
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:46,940
<i>Even if Ms. Fujiwara is a nuisance,
I'll forgive her just for tonight.</i>

4
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:51,152
<i>She even cancelled her vacation
and asked me to go with her.</i>

5
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,323
<i>Summer vacation was really boring but...</i>

6
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,951
<i>We're all going together
for the first time.</i>

7
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,036
You look just the same.

8
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>I'm going with the President
for the first time.</i>

9
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,667
<i>Instead of watching from my window,</i>

10
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,836
<i>I will get to see
the big fireworks up close.</i>

11
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,504
<i>That has been my dream.</i>

12
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,928
<i>Even though summer vacation was boring,</i>

13
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,474
<i>tonight is going to make everything
a good memory for me.</i>

14
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,605
Have fun.

15
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,612
<i>It was such a boring summer vacation...</i>

16
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
You can't go.

17
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,410
Your recent behavior
has been unacceptable.

18
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,165
If you're in a crowd,
our security will lose sight of you.

19
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,542
If something happens to you,

20
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,878
I wouldn't know what to tell your father.

21
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,466
<i>He wouldn't care at all.</i>

22
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,137
"I'm really sorry."

23
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,638
I CAN NO LONGER GO TODAY I'M SORRY

24
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,681
Kaguya...

25
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,525
<i>I want to see everyone.</i>

26
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,363
<i>I wish I didn't know about this.</i>

27
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,574
<i>If I hadn't known...</i>

28
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,826
<i>It would have been just another summer.</i>

29
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,121
<i>I wouldn't have to suffer so much.</i>

30
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,418
<i>But... I'll be okay.</i>

31
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,962
<i>Summer will come to an end.</i>

32
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,089
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

33
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,634
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

34
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,969
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

35
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,605
I'll be okay.

THIS IS MY FIRST TWEET

38
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,373
I WANT TO SEE FIREWORKS WITH EVERYONE

39
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,752
Got it.

40
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,088
THIS IS MY FIRST TWEET

41
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,006
I WANT TO SEE FIREWORKS WITH EVERYONE

42
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,349
Ms. Kaguya, how long
are you going to sulk in bed?

43
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,558
That's not like you.

44
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:33,231
Normally, you would've found a way
to sneak out of the house by now.

45
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,567
No matter how hard I try,
it never works out.

46
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,237
I can't even go shopping with my friends.

47
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,366
Father has no interest in me...

48
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:49,414
The President didn't even send me
an email this past month.

49
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,292
Nothing is working out for me!

50
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,003
Even if I sneak out now,
it will be pointless.

51
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,255
I'll never be able to see my friends.

52
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,258
No, you'll see your friends
when school starts

53
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,634
whether you like it or not.

54
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,387
Things go from bad to worse...

55
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,598
When she gets depressed,
she really goes to a dark place.

56
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,643
You're right.

57
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,730
This has been a rough summer for you.

58
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:18,609
But if you think about it, not being able
to see President Shirogane this summer

59
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:23,489
was actually the best choice.

60
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,245
The longer you don't see each other,
the deeper your love becomes.

61
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,749
The President is probably
feeling the same way as you right now.

62
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,421
<i>Every day, he longs to see you.</i>

63
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,716
<i>He can't wait for the summer to end.</i>

64
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,970
At the same time,

65
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,474
if both of you see each other
in the most dramatic way...

66
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,352
All of his accumulated desire...

67
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,565
Would explode all at once?

68
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,068
Yes, that's right.

69
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,986
You're looking like yourself again.

70
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,782
But there's two guards
watching over me today.

71
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,286
There's no way to escape
since I haven't planned for it.

72
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,788
Plans?

73
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,796

FOUR KINGS OF RAMEN
J. SUZUKI FROM KOENJI

75
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,852
Take me to Hamamatsucho.

76
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,399
Ms. Kaguya, dinner is ready.

77
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,236
I don't need any.

78
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,153
But...

79
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,155
I'm watching the fireworks.

80
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,242
Can't you at least let me watch it?

81
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,368
Very well.

82
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,502
Just kidding.

83
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,508
Now I know what's going on.

84
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,477
Ms. Kaguya?

85
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,438
She might be close by.

86
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,649
Fujiwara, wait there.

87
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:30,158
<i>The phone you're calling
is either out of range or turned off.</i>

88
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,368
I can't get through.

89
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:33,744
Is it the crowd?

90
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:37,039
Or is it because my phone is old?

91
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,583
Why?

92
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,669
You're trying to get
to the fireworks festival?

93
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,922
Traffic is bad because of street closures.

94
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,550
You might not make it in time.

95
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,845
<i>I won't make it?</i>

96
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,972
<i>After everything that Hayasaka did for me?</i>

97
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,765
<i>No way!</i>

98
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,102
<i>Why doesn't anything seem to work?</i>

99
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,732
Excuse me.

100
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,816
Yes?

101
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,277
I'll walk from here.

102
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,951
Be careful, young lady.

103
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,411
I will.

104
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,468
<i>Our meeting spot is Takeshiba Wharf.</i>

105
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,220
<i>The main streets are crowded.</i>

106
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,139
<i>If I run through the back streets
I should make it just in time.</i>

107
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,146
<i>I'll be able to see them.</i>

108
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,525
<i>The first junior student I helped.</i>

109
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,195
<i>My first friend at school.</i>

110
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,367
<i>The first person I liked.</i>

111
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,829
<i>I have a circle of friends
that I'm a part of!</i>

112
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,586
<i>If I could watch the fireworks</i>

113
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,464
<i>with the people I like,</i>

114
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,424
<i>I couldn't be any happier.</i>

115
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,678
<i>What a wonderful experience that would be.</i>

116
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,347
<i>That's all I was thinking about
during the entire summer.</i>

117
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,266
<i>God...</i>

118
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,268
<i>This summer,</i>

119
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,896
<i>I don't need romance or love.</i>

120
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,441
<i>So...</i>

121
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,488
<i>Please, just let me be with my friends.</i>

122
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,618
<i>...has concluded.</i>

123
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,122
<i>Please, pick up your food, trash,
and beverages</i>

124
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:46,043
<i>before leaving the area.</i>

125
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,629
<i>I repeat.</i>

126
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:53,259
<i>Tonight's fireworks festival
has concluded.</i>

127
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,263
<i>Please, pick up your food, trash,
and beverages</i>

128
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:01,267
<i>before leaving the area.</i>

129
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,312
<i>I should have known.</i>

130
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,773
<i>God...</i>

131
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,109
<i>doesn't exist.</i>

132
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,536
I wonder if everyone
enjoyed the fireworks.

133
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,080
I sure hope so.

134
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,294
<i>I only got a glimpse of the
fireworks between the buildings.</i>

135
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,837
<i>But they were huge.</i>

136
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,632
<i>The fireworks that everyone saw</i>

137
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,051
<i>must have been beautiful.</i>

138
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:41,015
<i>If everyone had fun, then I'm satisfied.</i>

139
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,319
I wish I could've seen...

140
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,905
the fireworks...

141
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,367
with everyone.

142
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,537
Then I'll show them to you.

143
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,208
President?

144
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,461
Come with me, Shinomiya!

145
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,547
If you want to see them so bad,
I'll show them to you.

146
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,132
How...

147
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,469
How did you know I was here?

148
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,641
You mean the "Guess What Shinomiya
Is Thinking and Find Her Game"?

149
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,978
It was 100 times easier than usual.

150
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,778
Kaguya!

151
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,948
President, I found us a cab.

152
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,658
It's the same girl!

153
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,077
Everyone, get in!

154
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,678
Driver,

155
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,346
take the freeway,

156
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,265
then get on the Aqua-Line to Umihotaru.

157
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,768
There's a fireworks festival
that was postponed until tonight

158
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,686
due to the rain.

159
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,397
President, are you thinking...

160
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,731
We're going to Chiba!

161
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,734
The fireworks in Kisarazu
ends at 8:30 p.m.!

162
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,072
Can we get to Chiba in 20 minutes?

163
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,240
I don't know.

164
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,409
But it's worth the risk.

165
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,370
Let's show some fireworks to Shinomiya!

166
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,042
I'm going to step on the gas a bit.

167
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,503
Don't tell anyone, okay?

168
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>Who is this cool driver?</i>

169
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,050
FOUR KINGS OF RAMEN
J. SUZUKI FROM KOENJI

170
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,931
God, get us there on time!

171
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,855
President, I can't see anything outside.

172
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,942
The Aqua-Line is an underwater tunnel,
so you won't be able to see anything.

173
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,570
We're approaching the Umihotaru parking!

174
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,155
We're going to the surface!

175
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,158
Get us there on time!

176
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,493
Get us there on time!

177
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,708
Get us there on time!

178
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,823
<i>Everyone watched the fireworks.</i>

179
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,578
<i>But, I'm sorry.</i>

180
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,125
<i>I couldn't take my eyes off...</i>

181
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,629
<i>his face.</i>

182
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,218
<i>My heart was beating so loud.</i>

183
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,145
<i>I couldn't even hear...</i>

184
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,481
<i>the fireworks.</i>

185
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,984
FIRST DAY OF THE NEW SEMESTER

186
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,861
<i>The first day of the new semester.</i>

187
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,155
<i>All the students have mixed emotions</i>

188
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,616
<i>about going back to their daily routine.</i>

189
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,787
<i>At the end of an uneventful
and long summer vacation,</i>

190
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,500
{\an8}<i>they all experienced something
that was memorable.</i>

191
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,628
{\an8}STAKE OUT SPOT 6 HOURS BEFORE FIREWORKS

192
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,422
FIND SHINOMIYA GO TO KISARAZU BY CAB

193
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,174
<i>Shirogane looked back on his efforts.</i>

194
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,636
Then I'll show them to you.

195
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,558
<i>He was dying from regret!</i>

196
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:58,772
You mean the "Guess What Shinomiya
Is Thinking and Find Her Game"?

197
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,275
That is so embarrassing!

198
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,526
I'm such a dork!

199
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,365
<i>A dark past.</i>

200
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:13,579
<i>Since he barely got to see Kaguya
during the summer vacation,</i>

201
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,498
<i>when he saw Kaguya
on the night of the fireworks,</i>

202
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,085
-<i>he was in a state of euphoria.</i>
-I found her!

203
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,838
<i>-Being in a euphoric state,</i>
-Then I'll show them to you.

204
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,299
<i>-he blurted out cringy lines.</i>
-"Guess What

205
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,217
Shinomiya Is Thinking and Find Her Game."

206
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,429
It was 100 times easier than usual.

207
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,472
I don't know.

208
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,016
But it's worth the risk.

209
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,396
<i>For the next ten years,</i>

210
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,776
<i>this dark memory will haunt him
every time he remembers it.</i>

211
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,655
<i>If I see Shinomiya now...</i>

212
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,283
I don't know what to say but...

213
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,952
what you said that night was...

214
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,453
How can I put it?

215
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,581
You sounded really narcissistic.

216
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,583
President...

217
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,169
What you said was really cringy.

218
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,422
<i>Somebody, please kill me!</i>

219
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,342
Looking forward to the new semester!

220
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,135
Hi, Fujiwara...

221
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,388
And Shinomiya...

222
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,014
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

223
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,237
<i>She's ignoring me.</i>

224
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,324
<i>She thinks I'm so cringy
that she can't even look at me!</i>

225
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,744
Shinomiya, the other night...

226
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,505
<i>-I totally messed up.</i>
-There's dust here.

227
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,925
<i>She thinks that I'm so cringy
that she doesn't even want to be near me.</i>

228
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>False.</i>

229
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,929
<i>Kaguya is ignoring Shirogane.</i>

230
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,807
<i>But not because she doesn't like him.</i>

231
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,642
<i>On the contrary,</i>

232
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:03,313
<i>she is acting like that
because she is shy and nervous.</i>

233
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,775
<i>It's commonly known
as "ignoring your crush."</i>

234
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,404
<i>Why am I avoiding him?</i>

235
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,491
<i>That would actually mean...</i>

236
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,578
<i>I have feelings for the President!</i>

237
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,996
<i>I have to talk to him...</i>

238
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,165
<i>Like how we used to talk
before the summer.</i>

239
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,084
<i>I need to regain Shinomiya's trust.</i>

240
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,296
<i>Act natural and cheerful.</i>

241
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,467
<i>First, I have to say hi to her...</i>

242
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:40,267
<i>They are walking straight
towards each other.</i>

243
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,978
<i>They should easily be able
to talk to each other.</i>

244
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,774
<i>However...</i>

245
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,831
Fujiwara, you should clean
the floor first.

246
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,917
Oh, you're right.

247
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,378
There's dust...

248
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,216
<i>I can't speak to her.</i>

249
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,675
I'll clean up over here.

250
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,638
<i>...they muster up
the courage to try again!</i>

251
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,808
<i>But the results are still the same.</i>

252
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:25,270
<i>Oh, no. The closer I get to him,
the more I can't look at his face!</i>

253
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,315
<i>How can I talk to her?</i>

254
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,443
<i>The way they barely miss each other,</i>

255
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,447
<i>is similar to the dogfights
of fighter aircrafts.</i>

256
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,410
<i>Passing each other twice isn't normal.</i>

257
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,787
<i>Is this a coincidence?</i>

258
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,581
<i>I understand now.</i>

259
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,625
<i>He's shy.</i>

260
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:51,255
<i>If that's the case, there's no need
for me to be embarrassed.</i>

261
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,465
<i>I'm calm.</i>

262
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,008
<i>I can do this.</i>

263
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,469
<i>This time, I won't fail.</i>

264
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,304
<i>I can talk to her!</i>

265
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,817
<i>An asterisk!</i>

266
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,282
Fujiwara, are you making fun of me?

267
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,909
Focus on cleaning the room!

268
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,204
I don't understand the rules of this game?

269
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>I have to talk to her
and clear up this misunderstanding!</i>

270
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,208
<i>I won't fail!</i>

271
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,459
<i>That's it!</i>

272
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,836
<i>It's not an asterisk.</i>

273
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,504
What's up?

274
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,092
<i>It's delta!</i>

275
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,099
What are you thinking?
Are you making fun of me, too?

276
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,560
What did I do?

277
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:50,230
You don't get it, do you?

278
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,399
Why does everyone despise me
all of a sudden?

279
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,235
Ishigami, you think
I'm pathetic don't you?

280
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,403
President, you too?

281
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,699
I'm sorry.

282
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,493
I don't know what's going on,
but I'm going home.

283
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,120
<i>Ishigami, shot down.</i>

284
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,956
Too bad, but he shouldn't have interfered.

285
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,625
Fujiwara, don't interfere with us either.

286
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,465
Why me?

287
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,050
<i>Fujiwara, shot down.</i>

288
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,763
<i>Why is everyone bothering us?</i>

289
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,182
<i>I can see why I might avoid her.</i>

290
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,935
<i>But why would Shinomiya ignore me?</i>

291
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,854
<i>Maybe...</i>

292
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,024
<i>She has feelings for me?</i>

293
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,401
<i>Stay calm.</i>

294
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,612
<i>Just close your eyes.</i>

295
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,989
<i>Maybe she doesn't think I'm cringy,</i>

296
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,033
<i>and she thinks I'm cool?</i>

297
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,702
<i>Shirogane regains confidence.</i>

298
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,287
<i>I'm going to do it!</i>

299
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,997
<i>I can do it.</i>

300
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:06,348
I have something
I want to tell you, President.

301
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,685
President, the night of the fireworks...

302
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,938
<i>I have to say...</i>

303
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,774
<i>Thank you.</i>

304
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,113
Well...

305
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,865
I wanted to say...

306
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,369
<i>President, the night of the fireworks...</i>

307
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:33,083
<i>Cringy.</i>

308
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,668
<i>You're so cringy.</i>

309
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:37,921
You're...

310
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,549
You're right!

311
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,342
<i>Shirogane, shot down.</i>

312
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,469
President!

313
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,762
I want to tell you something!

314
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,182
I know what you want to say!

315
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,101
Please, wait up, President!

316
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,438
<i>Things are back to normal.</i>

317
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,355
TODAY'S RESULT,
SHINOYIMA IS THE TOP SHOOTER

318
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,232
<i>The second semester has begun.</i>

319
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,037
<i>Romantic battle of the minds.</i>

320
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,541
<i>A battle between a boy and a girl
who are too proud to confess their love.</i>

321
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,668
<i>They can't say how they feel,</i>

322
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,379
<i>so they continue to hope.</i>

323
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,297
<i>That the other one confesses their love.</i>

324
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,717
I'm going to do everything
to make you say...

325
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,054
<i>that you love me.</i>
