1
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:03,420
Uniform change!

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,423
It has been so humid lately.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,259
Just wearing short sleeves
is so comfortable!

4
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:10,969
That's true.

5
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,898
CONFESSION

6
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,400
Relationship advice?

7
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,443
Yes.

8
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,154
I don't know what to do.

9
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:57,283
{\an8}I heard that the student council
also gives advice on these matters.

10
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,494
{\an8}I can only rely on you, Ms. Kaguya.

11
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,371
I understand.

12
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,249
Like our President always says,

13
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,253
listening to the worries of students
is the duty of the student council.

14
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:09,879
Then,

15
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,799
what kind of problem
do you need advice on?

16
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,678
How to break up with
my boyfriend smoothly.

17
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,518
<i>I thought it would be advice on getting
a boyfriend or confessing your love.</i>

18
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,272
<i>Advice on having a boyfriend.</i>

19
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,983
Ms. Kaguya, you are so popular,

20
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,111
-so you must know a lot about dating
<i>-But how can I give advice</i>

21
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,823
-you surely have a good idea!
<i>-when I never dated anyone seriously?</i>

22
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,617
<i>Her expectations are so great.</i>

23
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,079
<i>But I have always taken responsibility
for people,</i>

24
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,415
<i>so I won't ever say I can't do it,
no matter what.</i>

25
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,125
<i>I just have to get through this.</i>

26
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,252
Why do you want to break up?

27
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,670
That is...

28
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,423
because he confessed
his feelings suddenly.

29
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,927
<i>I got caught in the moment and said yes.</i>

30
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,971
<i>but I don't really know him,</i>

31
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,973
<i>and I don't know how to get close to him.</i>

32
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,893
<i>We're even more distanced than before.</i>

33
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,687
<i>I feel bad about it.</i>

34
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,024
<i>So I thought that to break up
would be better than being like this.</i>

35
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,154
That's right.

36
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,073
Until a while ago,
he was just another classmate,

37
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,910
so you don't know what you feel about him.

38
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,621
It's not like you hate him, right?

39
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,331
Of course not.

40
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,668
But I don't know
if this can be called romantic feelings.

41
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,465
First, why don't we start
by knowing his good qualities?

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,717
-What do I like about him?
-Yes.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,054
Anybody has good or cute traits.

44
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,307
For example, being earnest,

45
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,351
good at studying,

46
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,561
hardworking,

47
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,815
being truly kind and not abandoning
people when they need help.

48
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,486
Or having a threatening look.

49
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,656
Wouldn't having a threatening look be bad?

50
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,698
No!

51
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,035
I think having a threatening look
can be cute!

52
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,121
You like people
who have a threatening look?

53
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,790
Forget what I just said.

54
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:12,293
When I think of who has
a threatening look around you...

55
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,795
That's not it.

56
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,463
Let's continue our talk.

57
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,924
<i>You can find one good quality.</i>

58
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,176
<i>Begin thinking, "that's nice!"</i>

59
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,553
<i>Then, you'll start noticing
even more good traits.</i>

60
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,140
<i>By the time you notice it,
you can't take your eyes off him.</i>

61
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,767
<i>When you see them every day,</i>

62
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,603
you'll gradually fall in love with them.

63
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,564
That's what an acquaintance said to me.

64
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,483
I'm not talking about me.

65
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,818
You're not?

66
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,529
This is really not about me.

67
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,823
There is no one that I like.

68
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,408
But what you just said...

69
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,952
I heard what you were talking about.

70
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,078
Fujiwara?

71
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,498
That's so unfair of you
to talk about romance without me.

72
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:54,419
{\an8}Leave this kind of talk to me,
Chika, the love detective!

73
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,755
Why are you wheezing?

74
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,091
I was actually listening
to you from the start,

75
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,969
but I dashed to the drama club
and borrowed this costume.

76
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,807
You are worrying because you don't know
if you love your boyfriend.

77
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,225
That was it, right?

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,143
Yes.

79
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,229
Then, I would help you find

80
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,149
this lost thing called love!

81
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,608
Then,

82
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,612
try to imagine he is flirting
with someone else.

83
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,114
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,199
Just try to imagine it.

85
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,208
I feel gloomy.

86
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,253
I am angry. Very angry!

87
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,339
Somehow, you don't feel good.

88
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,424
Right?

89
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,760
In other words, that's jealousy.

90
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,805
You feel bad about it
because you like him.

91
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,976
If you feel bad, it means you love him!

92
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,020
Love?

93
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,396
That's why...

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,275
-You also like your boyfriend, Kashiwagi.
-Don't tell me...

95
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,278
-You should cherish that feeling.
-I love him.

96
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,321
I see.

97
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:07,241
I was thinking that I am a cold person,
not being able to like somebody

98
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,203
who confessed their feelings to me.

99
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,204
But...

100
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,331
That's right!

101
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,041
I really like him!

102
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,168
<i>The situation continues to take shape.</i>

103
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:23,633
-How can I speak more naturally to him?
<i>-I have to give her accurate advice.</i>

104
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,426
That's right.

105
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,678
How about using

106
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,349
the Romeo and Juliet effect
for cognitive balance?

107
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,559
-Romeo and Juliet?
-Romeo and Juliet?

108
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,270
<i>Romeo and Juliet had obstacles in love</i>

109
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,149
<i>and by having a common
and powerful enemy opposing them,</i>

110
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,568
<i>their love deepened.</i>

111
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,863
<i>A powerful enemy?</i>

112
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,032
It doesn't have to be a person.

113
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,701
It can also be a common imaginary enemy.

114
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,829
I don't know about such an enemy...

115
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,788
No.

116
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,208
There is an enemy
who everybody must stand against!

117
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,835
Who is that?

118
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,503
That is...

119
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,672
the society!

120
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,715
The society?

121
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,760
The never-ending wars,
the constant gap between rich and poor...

122
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,681
-There is no greater enemy!
<i>-But I meant exams or small worries.</i>

123
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,558
I see!

124
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,686
We should both oppose
this corrupt society.

125
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,104
That's quite a big scale problem!

126
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,355
I understand.

127
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,315
We will both start preparing immediately.

128
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,568
-Do your best!
-Wait a little!

129
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,696
Is that all right?

130
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,657
Haven't we created antisocial misfits?

131
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,202
It's all right.

132
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,000
Please contribute to fund-raising
for charity!

133
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,793
Please!

134
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,504
Please contribute to fund-raising
for charity!

135
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,091
Apparently, they were both interested
in charity work from the start.

136
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,635
It seems to have turned
into a good opportunity.

137
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,013
Wishing for peace...

138
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:56,684
That really is opposing society
in the true sense of the word.

139
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,977
What are you saying?

140
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:03,065
<i>Her boyfriend is the one who came
to the president for advice.</i>

141
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,114
President?

142
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,034
Shinomiya?

143
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,536
Why are you with them?

144
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,665
Oh, I registered for the fund-raising
as an extracurricular activity.

145
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,254
They don't seem to be doing it
on a whim or as a hobby

146
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,299
and when I see the two of them
unexperienced but fervent,

147
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,969
I can't do much,
but I wanted to support them.

148
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,972
Good grief.

149
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,266
This kind of activity doesn't suit me.

150
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,022
That is what I like about you.

151
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:47,151
<i>Today's result, Kaguya lost.</i>

152
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,195
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE
TO THE FUND-RAISING FOR CHARITY

153
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,072
PLEASE

154
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,834
<i>Punch it!</i>

155
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,259
<i>I almost hit it!</i>

156
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,802
<i>Unathletic person.</i>

157
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,305
<i>Shirogane excels at studying,</i>

158
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:21,060
<i>but in regard to all sports,
he is a catastrophe unfit for human eyes.</i>

159
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,981
<i>He delivered newspapers for many years,
worked as a mover in summer,</i>

160
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,484
<i>and he can commute
15 kilometers every day by bicycle.</i>

161
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,363
<i>His physical ability is
by no means reduced.</i>

162
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,117
<i>He is desperately lacking
a sense of coordination.</i>

163
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,368
<i>That is the cause.</i>

164
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,913
<i>For him to maintain
his position at Shuchiin,</i>

165
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,292
<i>he needs an extraordinary amount
of practice every day.</i>

166
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,711
<i>There is a volleyball class next week.</i>

167
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,464
<i>I need to improve until then,
so I can play in front of people.</i>

168
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,383
<i>If I'm like this...</i>

169
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,427
Please take it seriously.

170
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,221
That thing that looks like
a dead alpaca is the president?

171
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,222
Really?

172
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,141
That dead alpaca?

173
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,811
How cute of you.

174
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,896
<i>No way!</i>

175
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,109
Why can't I do it right?

176
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,695
Are you okay, President?

177
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,196
Yes, it's okay...

178
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,906
Secretary Fujiwara?

179
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,617
What are you doing?

180
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,493
I forgot something.

181
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,703
Well...

182
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,954
<i>Did she see me?</i>

183
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,123
<i>Did she see how stupidly I moved around?</i>

184
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,875
<i>No. I'm done.</i>

185
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,460
<i>No more being good in sports and studying.</i>

186
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,338
<i>The brand of "President Shirogane"
who is good at everything.</i>

187
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,423
<i>My image,
that I can do everything perfectly,</i>

188
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>without working hard at it.</i>

189
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,554
I didn't really study for the test.

190
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,805
This is bad.

191
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,435
Playing with the ball is fun!

192
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
<i>Anyway.</i>

193
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,106
<i>No matter what she thinks,
she can't do that much damage.</i>

194
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,026
The volleyball class will start soon.

195
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,945
I reserved the sports hall
and was practicing.

196
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,198
Somehow my serve is very bad.

197
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,075
Oh, I see.

198
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,661
Would you like me to teach you?

199
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,621
You?

200
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,832
If you want to teach someone
you have to be able to do it yourself.

201
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,710
I can play volleyball at least.

202
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,878
Look!

203
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:13,881
See?

204
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,716
Amazing!

205
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,802
What a polished serve!

206
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,053
Right?

207
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,223
I didn't know you had such skill!

208
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,478
If I teach you, you would surely get
really good in no time.

209
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,939
President.

210
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:34,068
What kind of attitude should you have
when asking people to teach you something?

211
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,156
Please, teach me.

212
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,325
Yes, of course.

213
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,121
First, let's find out
what the problems are.

214
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,873
Try to serve a couple of times.

215
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,513
Why does it turn out like that?

216
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,848
I also don't understand.

217
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,435
No matter how often I do it,
my hand clashes against my head.

218
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,563
If I mind my head, I screw up the timing.

219
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,482
It's a complete dead end.

220
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,359
What? Oh, yes.

221
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,988
First, keep your eyes open
when you hit the ball.

222
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,865
Why are you telling me obvious things?

223
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,992
That's right, it's obvious.

224
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,995
So then, open your eyes wide
and hit the ball.

225
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,205
What will that change?

226
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,630
See? It's still no good.

227
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,882
You didn't open them!

228
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,508
You didn't open them.

229
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,470
Why are you saying "it's no use"
when you didn't do it?

230
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,598
Look, you didn't open your eyes,
not even one millimeter.

231
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,475
No way!

232
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,644
Can it be that I am too nervous
to perform?

233
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,562
That's ridiculous!

234
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:56,525
Maybe the image of yourself moving
and your actual movement aren't in sync.

235
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,528
Let's practice jumping
with your eyes open.

236
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,530
I will train you mercilessly.

237
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,615
So keep up.

238
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,741
Please.

239
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,534
<i>Then...</i>

240
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:10,873
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

241
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:15,169
556, 557, 558, 559...

242
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,254
-Jump with your eyes open.
<i>-984, 985...</i>

243
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,550
<i>Three days passed with special training,
day and night.</i>

244
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,224
President, maybe this is enough, right?

245
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,685
You're not as bad at it
as you were before, right?

246
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,898
It's great progress
compared to when you were like a beast.

247
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,358
Not yet.

248
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,528
I can train even more.

249
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,905
Why are you training so hard?

250
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,200
I don't want to show my bad qualities.

251
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,995
If I am to show anything,
it should be my cool side!

252
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,546
Is that meant for the person you like?

253
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,799
That's totally mistaken.
There's nobody special!

254
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,176
You don't have anything to hide, right?

255
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,886
-Who is it?
-Shut up!

256
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,596
Please tell me!

257
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,681
You're too insistent!

258
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,569
We did it! We did it!

259
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,113
Oh, it's thank to you, Secretary Fujiwara.

260
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,156
That was hard!

261
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,492
But you followed through nicely!

262
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,244
All right, Fujiwara.

263
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,539
Next, please teach me
how to throw and receive a ball.

264
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,088
ONE WEEK LATER

265
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,388
-Amazing!
-Shirogane!

266
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,148
Fujiwara?

267
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,943
I raised that kid.

268
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,944
His mother?

269
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:08,490
<i>Today's result,
Shirogane and Fujiwara win.</i>

270
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,993
WILL YOU TRAIN OTHER ATHLETES AS WELL?

271
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,911
WELL, HONESTLY...

272
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,203
I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

273
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,709
{\an8}<i>By the way, the accountant
Ishigami seems to have</i>

274
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,628
{\an8}<i>finished cleaning up
after the mixer before.</i>

275
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,339
So, there isn't really anything
to do today.

276
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,090
Should we take the day off?

277
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,469
Yes! Then you can call someone
to pick you up, Kaguya.

278
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,762
Actually...

279
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,765
The car that usually picks me up
has a flat tire,

280
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,391
so I will walk home.

281
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,019
What if you are kidnapped?

282
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,065
It's easy to be targeted on rainy days
because it's hard to find any traces.

283
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,692
Please don't make me feel anxious.

284
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,821
I would love to drop you off,
but I have some errands to run today.

285
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,240
<i>-Shinomiya is walking home?</i>
-Thank you for offering.

286
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,576
<i>Then, it might work.</i>

287
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,079
<i>The season's turning point, rainy season.</i>

288
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,914
{\an8}<i>Sharing an umbrella!</i>

289
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,959
<i>It's the standard event
through which a quick intimacy is achieved</i>

290
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,962
<i>by two people cuddling up
under one umbrella.</i>

291
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,465
<i>The rainy season is the best season
to share an umbrella!</i>

292
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,925
<i>That's stupid.</i>

293
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,637
<i>It's despicable to brush
against one another under one umbrella.</i>

294
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,680
<i>However,</i>

295
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:17,101
<i>let's acknowledge that the gesture
of sharing an umbrella also makes sense.</i>

296
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:21,438
<i>When it comes to romance, what you should
fear most is the summer vacation magic.</i>

297
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,732
<i>Summer vacation with a lover.</i>

298
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,776
<i>Within that brand,</i>

299
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:31,031
<i>an estimation of the opposite sex begins
on school grounds before the vacation.</i>

300
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:39,790
<i>The sharing of an umbrella with a special
someone has the appeal of intimacy.</i>

301
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:45,671
<i>It's very effective in excluding someone
as a candidate of a summer romance.</i>

302
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,216
It's raining hard.

303
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,344
It wasn't raining in the morning, but...

304
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,140
<i>Sharing an umbrella
usually occurs in a definite way.</i>

305
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,685
<i>First, person A forgets their umbrella
and is left standing.</i>

306
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,397
<i>Second, person B is unable to remain
indifferent and asks, "Want to share it?"</i>

307
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,690
COMPLETE!

308
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,191
-Then let's go home.
<i>-Therefore,</i>

309
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,735
<i>-in order to share an umbrella,</i>
-Yes.

310
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,279
<i>you have to appeal by forgetting yours.</i>

311
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,530
<i>However...</i>

312
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,074
-Oh, I forgot my umbrella.
-Oh, I forgot my umbrella.

313
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,243
<i>Conflict!</i>

314
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:21,040
<i>Sharing an umbrella begins with the fact
that one person forgets the umbrella.</i>

315
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,917
<i>However, if both forget their umbrellas,</i>

316
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,878
<i>there is no possibility for development.</i>

317
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,839
<i>It just means that they both forgot it.</i>

318
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,675
Did you forget
your umbrella, too, Shinomiya?

319
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,593
Yes.

320
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,763
I usually get picked up,
so it slipped my mind.

321
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,264
What about you?

322
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,725
I forgot to watch the weather report.

323
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,061
I didn't think the weather
would be this bad.

324
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,524
<i>A bluff, of course!</i>

325
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,528
<i>They both have a folding umbrella
in their bags.</i>

326
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,571
<i>What should I do?</i>

327
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,240
<i>Should I tell her I have an umbrella?</i>

328
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,326
<i>But if I do that...</i>

329
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,453
Well, well.

330
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:03,707
You wanted to share my umbrella so badly
that you lie to me like that?

331
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,959
Good grief.

332
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,669
How cute of you.

333
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,629
<i>It's hopeless!</i>

334
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,716
<i>Pulling out an umbrella now
would expose a meaningful lie.</i>

335
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,720
<i>And that would directly connect to invite
the other person to share an umbrella.</i>

336
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,847
<i>That would be a clear defeat.</i>

337
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,140
<i>Wait a little.</i>

338
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,725
<i>If she didn't have a car,</i>

339
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,978
<i>the staff at the manor
would make her take an umbrella.</i>

340
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,731
<i>There is no way they would be so careless.</i>

341
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,483
<i>I know, President.</i>

342
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,486
<i>You have an umbrella in that bag, right?</i>

343
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,989
<i>You're embarrassed to share it with me,
that's why you're lying like this.</i>

344
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,075
<i>These are the conditions for victory.</i>

345
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,701
<i>There's nothing left,</i>

346
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,662
<i>but to point out that
the other person is lying.</i>

347
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,164
Well, Shinomiya.

348
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,916
You actually have one, right?

349
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,918
<i>Shirogane charged first.</i>

350
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,713
The car had a flat tire on a day it rains.

351
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,926
But today, you who always plans ahead
forgot an umbrella.

352
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,304
I wonder if that's really possible.

353
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,892
What do you want to say?

354
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,185
Nothing in particular.

355
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,104
<i>I lack information.</i>

356
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,316
<i>-I can't get her to admit it after all.</i>
-If anyone is calculated, it's you.

357
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,568
What?

358
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,822
You said earlier
that you missed the weather report,

359
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,365
but that's strange.

360
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,242
What's strange about it?

361
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,952
Even I have days like that.

362
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,372
You always commute by bicycle.

363
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,708
That's right.

364
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,209
Then...

365
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,296
why did you take the train today?

366
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,049
I saw that your bicycle
with a basket up front

367
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,719
wasn't in the parking lot today.

368
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,970
<i>What?</i>

369
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:44,224
Now that I think about it,
there is nothing strange at all.

370
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,685
When it rains, you commute by train.

371
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,479
It's an understandable behavior.

372
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,814
Right, President?

373
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,443
You said you missed the weather report.

374
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,697
So why did you take
the train today of all days?

375
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,074
You really...

376
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,620
saw it, right?

377
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,538
The weather report.

378
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,167
<i>What a difference being prepared makes.</i>

379
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,171
Were you perhaps
under the impression that I forgot?

380
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:18,634
President, how about you look again
in that bag of yours?

381
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,346
<i>The difference in preparation
of coming here will decide the outcome.</i>

382
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,892
<i>Shirogane didn't even spend one hour
when planning the sharing of the umbrella.</i>

383
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,478
<i>Kaguya on the other hand,
checked the weather report,</i>

384
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,982
<i>read the weather map thoroughly,
pierced the car's tire with an awl,</i>

385
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,817
<i>checked if the bicycle was there.</i>

386
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,445
<i>Thus, she led by being very prepared.</i>

387
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,114
<i>Of course, she could
foresee this situation, too!</i>

388
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,658
<i>Now, let's double check!</i>

389
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,537
In the end, I have no choice,
but to get drenched walking home.

390
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,584
Kaguya, did you forget your umbrella?

391
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,423
I had an extra umbrella in the classroom,
so please use this!

392
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,219
Please take care from now on!

393
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,680
Don't be so careless, Kaguya.

394
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,223
See you tomorrow!

395
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,438
<i>I was in such a good spot right now!</i>

396
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,940
<i>Just a little longer...</i>

397
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,234
<i>Why is she always getting in the way?</i>

398
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,070
<i>Now, I...</i>

399
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,448
I'll give it to you.

400
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,326
I will give you this umbrella.

401
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,829
Please use it as you like!

402
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,248
But this is Fujiwara's umbrella!

403
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,541
I am subletting it.

404
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,583
But then...

405
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,425
Well...

406
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,599
How about I borrow half of it?

407
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,568
It can't be helped, right?

408
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,624
<i>Today's result,</i>

409
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,919
<i>a tie.</i>

410
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,104
