1
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,802
<i>The Shuchiin Middle School
is five minutes away</i>

2
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,012
<i>from the Shuchiin Academy on foot.</i>

3
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,597
<i>Due to that close distance,</i>

4
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,725
<i>many middle school students
who visit the Alumni Office</i>

5
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,851
<i>also visit the academy.</i>

6
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,605
<i>And on that day, one girl
is visiting the Student Council Room.</i>

7
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,775
Yes?

8
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,946
I am sorry for bothering you.

9
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,532
What a cute visitor.

10
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,951
<i>That was bad of me.</i>

11
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,079
<i>I shouldn't tell people to their face
that I think they're cute.</i>

12
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,665
<i>But for some reason, she captivated me.</i>

13
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,833
<i>I wonder why that is.</i>

14
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:09,295
I am the accountant of the Middle School
Student Council, Kei Shirogane.

15
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,465
<i>Kei Shirogane?</i>

16
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,843
<i>Shirogane...</i>

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,427
<i>This girl...</i>

18
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,847
<i>According to the rumors,
she is the president's sister!</i>

19
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,140
<i>She really is!</i>

20
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,851
<i>She has the same threatening eyes
and the same facial expression!</i>

21
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,562
Well, come in.

22
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,105
Okay. Please, excuse me.

23
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,818
{\an8}If you're looking for Shirogane,

24
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,904
{\an8}he is in a meeting with the clubs
to discuss the budget.

25
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,782
I don't think he'll be back for a while.

26
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,410
A meeting with the club? Is that...

27
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,456
<i>Back then, they said that the president
was impolite to them,</i>

28
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,793
<i>so it became difficult
for him to live in Japan.</i>

29
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,423
That story is mostly embellished.

30
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,301
Was it a false rumor?

31
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,969
Of course.

32
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,388
It's just that his father
was transferred to work

33
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,807
in a country a little farther away.

34
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,976
<i>So he was sent away?</i>

35
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,187
I wonder if he already got used to
the thin air there?

36
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,273
Will he be all right?

37
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,359
<i>His sister is anxious.</i>

38
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,946
He will be okay.

39
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:22,076
On my honor as a Shinomiya, I will protect
the president in case anything happened.

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,661
Miss Shinomiya.

41
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,165
It's all right. Leave it to me.

42
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,668
<i>If you want to shoot a general,
shoot his horse first.</i>

43
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,923
<i>If you want to take down a man,
entrap the ones around him first.</i>

44
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,426
<i>If you get along with his relatives,
you will get to hang out with his family,</i>

45
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,095
<i>then a more intimate interaction
can take place.</i>

46
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,972
Right, Kaguya?

47
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,684
<i>Oh, that would be good!</i>

48
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,062
<i>I will try to get her to call me "sister."</i>

49
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,066
Then, what did you want to talk
to him about today?

50
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:59,280
I want to ask him to check the handouts
for the Student Council.

51
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,699
Then you can rely on me for that.

52
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,786
Even though I look like this,
I can do quite a lot.

53
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,704
<i>The "Capable Woman" appeal!</i>

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,500
<i>By creating an image of competency,
she makes the other person respect her.</i>

55
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,169
<i>She is playing the part of a person
one would like to call "sister."</i>

56
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:17,048
The calculations are correct,
but the commas are written wrongly.

57
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,842
And the layout
isn't exactly easy on the eyes.

58
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,094
You were here?

59
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,512
I see.

60
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,182
So I should make this part bigger
and fill in the blank space here?

61
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,936
By the way, you can
use macro for these parts.

62
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,229
I see.

63
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,563
You could group these lines...

64
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,067
<i>It's hard to get close to someone
by playing the competent woman,</i>

65
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,903
<i>it could put a feeling of distance
between us.</i>

66
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,405
<i>We should be equals!</i>

67
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,908
<i>I should aim to have a relationship
so that we can hang out as friends.</i>

68
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,034
<i>And then...</i>

69
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,244
Kaguya!

70
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,956
It's been so long,
please come to our place for lunch!

71
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,374
Oh, sure!

72
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,087
You get along well.
It's as if you were real sisters!

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,339
But we are real sisters!

74
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:03,344
Kaguya is already like a daughter to me!

75
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,930
Why don't you start living here with us?

76
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,518
Wonderful.

77
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,062
<i>Kaguya was starving for family love.</i>

78
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,689
<i>Then, I...</i>

79
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,983
Shirogane?

80
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,028
We are all Shirogane here,

81
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,613
so why don't you use our given names?

82
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:28,036
Then, Miyuki...

83
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,206
Kaguya...

84
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,791
<i>Amazing!</i>

85
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,418
<i>Just how far can it go?</i>

86
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,379
-You choose a form and a table...
<i>-We could be friends!</i>

87
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,966
-And choose the format from the form.
<i>-A more intimate relation would be good!</i>

88
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,887
Miss Shirogane,
would you like something to drink?

89
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,346
Yes.

90
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,765
Hello!

91
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,600
Oh, Kei!

92
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,977
Good kills today!

93
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,271
Good kills today to you, too!

94
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,566
What's up?

95
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,651
Did you come to have some fun?

96
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,987
No, I came here about work.

97
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:09,077
Fujiwara and Shirogane,
do you know each other?

98
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,912
That's right!

99
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,915
Kei is in the same year as Moe.

100
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,292
I am Moe, the third daughter.

101
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,795
Sometimes we have a sleepover at our place

102
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:24,008
and even though I am three years older,
it feels like we are regular friends.

103
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,760
-Right?
-Right?

104
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,304
The other day we also played a video game.

105
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,430
Right?

106
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,183
We even made a dance for Kei.
Do you want to dance it here?

107
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:36,395
-What? It's embarrassing!
<i>-You hid and did these things sneakily.</i>

108
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,149
<i>Is that how it is?
Now, I get it, this is how you are.</i>

109
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,070
<i>But Fujiwara is just a friend after all.</i>

110
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,988
<i>There's definitely nothing more than that!</i>

111
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,406
Hey, sis!

112
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,491
<i>What?</i>

113
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,161
We are going shopping in Harajuku,

114
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,622
if you're free, would you like to come?

115
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,624
-I will, I will!
<i>-Sister...</i>

116
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,047
Window shopping in Harajuku would be nice!

117
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,674
<i>Fujiwara...</i>

118
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,344
<i>is always snatching away
the things I want the most, like this.</i>

119
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,346
<i>That's greedy.</i>

120
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,808
<i>This kind of people will ruin the Earth.</i>

121
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,478
<i>They're the cancer of the Earth.
How repulsive.</i>

122
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,106
Kaguya, will you come with us?

123
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,691
I will!

124
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,489
<i>Oh, well. Fujiwara is a good girl.</i>

125
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,241
<i>I like that about her.</i>

126
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,118
<i>I hope we'll be friends forever!</i>

127
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,665
How was the meeting today?

128
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,084
It was okay, somehow.

129
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,128
By the way,

130
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,338
did you come to our Student Council?

131
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,590
How was it?

132
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,091
How was what?

133
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,471
Well, as your big brother,
I worry about your behavior.

134
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,222
You're meddling and it's gross.

135
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,226
Well, Chika was the same as usual,

136
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,813
the accountant seemed gloomy
but he was nice to me.

137
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,983
And the vice president, Shinomiya...

138
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:09,989
I was nervous around her for some reason
and couldn't speak to her.

139
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,158
What did you say?

140
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,117
Shut up and die!

141
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,205
<i>Today's result,</i>

142
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,124
<i>Shirogane Kei lost.</i>

143
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,710
MOE, CHIKA, TOYOMI

144
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,422
{\an8}The final exams are coming up soon, right?

145
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,591
{\an8}Are you studying?

146
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,303
Fujiwara, don't whistle.

147
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,348
-There is no need to study for exams.
-What?

148
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,727
If you usually study properly,
you'll have no problem in the test.

149
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,981
What can last minute studying give you?
It just wears you down.

150
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,399
<i>That is a lie.</i>

151
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,945
Try your best to not
resort to cramming when studying.

152
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,031
<i>This man even took time off
from his part-time job.</i>

153
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,366
<i>He has been pulling all-nighters</i>

154
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,409
<i>not just before the test,
but for the last ten days.</i>

155
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,328
<i>The final tests.</i>

156
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,913
<i>At Shuchiin Academy,</i>

157
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,332
<i>literature and math tests
are held five times a year.</i>

158
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:05,211
<i>Shirogane has won the first place
for the last three consecutive years</i>

159
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,339
<i>and consolidated his leading position
in the academics.</i>

160
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:13,511
<i>For Shirogane, an external student,
his grades are his greatest lifeline.</i>

161
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,346
<i>In order to keep his first place position,</i>

162
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,099
<i>he won't hesitate to use lies or tactics.</i>

163
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,976
That's right.

164
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,479
Tests are supposed
to reflect your ability.

165
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,898
If you overstretch yourself
and get a good score,

166
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,817
you won't know your actual level.

167
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,110
<i>That is a lie.</i>

168
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,946
It's best to take the test
in a relaxed manner.

169
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,117
<i>This woman is earnestly dealing
with something for a change.</i>

170
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,121
<i>For her, losing is not necessarily
a humiliation.</i>

171
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:44,417
<i>That's because she thinks that
getting defeated is part of life.</i>

172
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,546
<i>However, when it comes to studying,
her attitude is different.</i>

173
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,132
<i>Even after the genius Shinomiya
did her best,</i>

174
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,010
<i>she still couldn't beat Shirogane.</i>

175
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,846
<i>Shinomiya, who is
the personification of pride,</i>

176
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,432
<i>cannot accept this at all.</i>

177
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,808
Ishigami?

178
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,395
If you don't push yourself a little,
your results will turn out bad.

179
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,230
If you get a failing mark again...

180
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,940
It's all right.

181
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,359
This time, I am studying for the test.

182
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,446
I will go home now and study.

183
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,572
<i>That is a lie.</i>

184
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,909
<i>This man wants to quickly continue
playing the game he bought recently.</i>

185
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,662
<i>He has some nerve
to buy a game before the test.</i>

186
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,122
<i>He lives so recklessly,</i>

187
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,374
<i>it's as if he already guessed
the time of his own death.</i>

188
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,627
<i>And then he usually gets failing marks.</i>

189
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,755
<i>This is the way Yu Ishigami does things.</i>

190
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,342
I don't know why I'm so bad in Japanese.

191
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:39,430
For foreign languages I use slang,
but that isn't enough for the test.

192
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,767
That's because you have a special way
of studying foreign languages.

193
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,686
Studying normally
might not be very efficient for you.

194
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,022
How much one studies

195
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,774
is not necessarily reflected
in the grades.

196
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,694
Not studying at all is also an option.

197
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,029
<i>That is a lie.</i>

198
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,447
That's right.

199
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,115
I don't study three days before the exam

200
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,993
and I just concentrate my mind
while in a meditation posture.

201
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,411
That works for me.

202
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,788
<i>That is a lie.</i>

203
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,000
I see. I understand!

204
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,753
I won't study!

205
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,755
<i>She means it.</i>

206
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,759
<i>This girl has been dragged
into Kaguya and Shirogane's sabotage.</i>

207
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,552
<i>As a result, her grades are worsening.</i>

208
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,637
100TH PLACE, 394 POINTS, NAKAMURA AKIHITO
AVERAGE

209
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,891
<i>Her grades are average,
but her will to study is great.</i>

210
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,644
<i>Despite her personality,
Fujiwara is an excellent student.</i>

211
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,270
<i>This is precisely why...</i>

212
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,483
<i>she doesn't question the words
from her top two ranked friends.</i>

213
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,570
<i>She doesn't notice
that they are playing dirty.</i>

214
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,574
<i>The competition for the best result
begins before picking up the pen.</i>

215
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,243
<i>Using not only knowledge,</i>

216
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,245
<i>but also information,
personal connections,</i>

217
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,705
<i>and assets and all that implies,
is the natural choice.</i>

218
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,960
<i>The geniuses use up all their ingenuity
and fight an imaginary battle.</i>

219
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,296
<i>That is a final test.</i>

220
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,551
197TH OUT OF 199 STUDENTS (1ST YEAR)

221
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,136
TEST DAY

222
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,680
I am nervous!

223
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,934
If my grades drop today,
they'll reduce my allowance.

224
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,271
Calm down. The test score
won't change if you panic now.

225
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,357
Aren't you nervous, President?

226
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,151
Of course not.

227
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,404
I believe in my ability.

228
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,699
I just have to use
what I've learned so far.

229
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,200
<i>That is a lie.</i>

230
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,413
<i>This man is so nervous
that he feels like he could vomit.</i>

231
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,083
<i>He is already trembling so hard
that he cannot even hold his pen properly.</i>

232
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,877
<i>I definitely won't lose.</i>

233
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,629
<i>Nobody can know this but him.</i>

234
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,631
<i>The pressure of the king</i>

235
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,259
<i>doesn't compare
to that of the challengers.</i>

236
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,595
<i>Being always asked to be perfect</i>

237
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,847
<i>is a burden too heavy to bear alone.</i>

238
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,100
<i>What does it mean
to compete with a genius?</i>

239
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,895
<i>How much should you sacrifice for it?</i>

240
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,565
<i>For him, studying is the only weapon.</i>

241
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,944
<i>If the girl who can do anything
would beat him at studying as well,</i>

242
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,948
<i>she would become a person far away,
whom one can only look up to.</i>

243
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,535
<i>He has to win!</i>

244
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,745
Start!

245
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,206
<i>I will never lose!</i>

246
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>In order to be on equal terms,</i>

247
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,960
<i>I won't lose to Shinomiya!</i>

248
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,135
Well done, Shinomiya.

249
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,848
Sometimes it's also about luck.
You never know next time.

250
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,310
No, I also know how much
effort you put into it.

251
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,562
It's not about luck.

252
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,273
As I thought, I need to improve.

253
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,193
I am content with this result, too.

254
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,736
<i>That is a lie.</i>

255
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:45,157
<i>This woman is so frustrated
that blood could spurt from her eyes.</i>

256
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,368
<i>If this weren't a public place,</i>

257
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,204
<i>she would stomp the ground
and roll around.</i>

258
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,166
<i>She was biting her lips
and keeping it all in.</i>

259
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,711
Aren't you happy
with the results, President?

260
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,548
It's your fourth year in a row now.

261
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,094
No, the pressure this time
was just too big.

262
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,599
Actually, when all of this ends,
all I feel is relief.

263
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,686
I don't have any energy left
to be happy about it.

264
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,146
Is that how it is?

265
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,652
<i>That is a lie.</i>

266
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,159
-Did you see that, Shinomiya?
<i>-This man is so happy that he is boxing.</i>

267
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:33,455
<i>Thus, the final exam
of lies and deceit is over.</i>

268
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,666
There, there. It's all right.

269
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,918
<i>Today's result,</i>

270
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,921
<i>Shirogane won.</i>

271
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,464
EXAM RESULTS OF THE FIRST SEMESTER:

272
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,550
MIYUKI SHIROGANE 1ST PLACE TO 1ST PLACE
SHINOMIYA KAGUYA 2ND PLACE TO 2ND PLACE

273
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,304
<i>Let's go back in time a little.</i>

274
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,388
ONE WEEK BEFORE THE EXAM

275
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,516
<i>Do you understand, Ishigami?</i>

276
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,687
If you get any more failing grades,
you might fall back in school.

277
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,444
After all your hard work to get in,
isn't it a shame to waste it?

278
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:10,451
Anyway, make sure you don't fail
the next final test. Do you understand?

279
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,660
Yes.

280
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,579
<i>Failing score.</i>

281
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,955
<i>At Shuchiin, the failing score</i>

282
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,374
<i>is less than the half
of the average grade.</i>

283
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,210
<i>There is no aid measure
like a makeup exam.</i>

284
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,880
<i>If you get a failing grade two times,
you fail the subject.</i>

285
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,632
<i>As soon as you fail
at a compulsory subject,</i>

286
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,549
<i>you repeat the year.</i>

287
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,260
<i>Ishigami has a yellow card
in three subjects.</i>

288
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,055
<i>If he gets another failing grade
he will have to repeat the year.</i>

289
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,598
That's right.

290
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,101
-I was thinking of buying a game...
<i>-Even though it could be terrible,</i>

291
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,229
-That's how relaxed I am.
<i>-he doesn't seem to sense the danger.</i>

292
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,400
{\an8}<i>That was unbecoming
for a member of the Student Council.</i>

293
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:47,112
{\an8}<i>If he falls behind, he won't be
the only who will one suffering.</i>

294
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,615
It takes about five hours...

295
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,158
Ishigami.

296
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,827
Please come with me for a little.

297
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,248
What is it?
Is it something you can't do here?

298
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,085
Yes, we're going to be needing a place

299
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,963
where no one is around so we can be alone.

300
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,589
No!

301
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,174
No! That's scary!

302
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,135
-No!
-Why are you scared? Come here!

303
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,888
Because you want to do something
awful to me!

304
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,556
SUPPLY ROOM

305
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,399
I only did this
because you tried to run away!

306
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,653
If you didn't fight back,
I wouldn't have gotten rough with you.

307
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,322
You will do something terrible to me!

308
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,329
What do you want to do to me?

309
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,082
You already know, though.

310
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,501
Which situation you are in.

311
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,338
That's why...

312
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,342
<i>After you make me endure
rigorous torture, you intend to kill me?</i>

313
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:54,930
<i>Or you might drive me mad
by doing something I hate.</i>

314
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:55,973
Anyway...

315
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,642
<i>Just please don't touch my games!</i>

316
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,437
I will confiscate
your smartphone and games.

317
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,775
<i>I did do something to displease her!</i>

318
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,529
<i>Now, she will thoroughly crush my spirit!</i>

319
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,697
<i>Please, stop.</i>

320
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,199
<i>Don't make me eat small fish...</i>

321
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,869
<i>-Or force me to study!</i>
-Then, firstly...

322
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:22,958
Eat many of these dried sardines,
and solve all these problems.

323
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,626
Here you go, eat.

324
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,005
It's full of docosahexaenoic acid.

325
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,842
<i>Acid? Will it dissolve
my internal organs slowly?</i>

326
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,803
SEVERAL HOURS LATER

327
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,351
PROFICIENCY TEST

328
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,438
<i>This is pretty awful.</i>

329
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,275
<i>But I caught a glimpse of his intelligence
in all important points.</i>

330
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,236
Looks like it's worth educating you!

331
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,449
Let's study together at the same time.

332
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,993
On my honor as a Shinomiya,

333
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,454
I won't let you get a failing grade,

334
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,622
so be grateful.

335
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,417
<i>Just what to you intend to do
to fix my head?</i>

336
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,628
AVOIDING THE FAILING GRADE

337
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:13,592
<i>Then, the special training continued
over several days.</i>

338
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,844
<i>As Ishigami tried to escape,</i>

339
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,596
<i>Kaguya would keep catching him</i>

340
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,768
<i>and before he knew it,
Ishigami lost the will to fight her.</i>

341
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,439
LIBRARY

342
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,360
I think this reference book
is easier to understand.

343
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,779
Don't panic and consciously try
to understand it.

344
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,616
What do you want, though, really?

345
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,159
What are you saying?

346
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,537
I heard that if you get
another failing grade

347
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,705
you will fall behind for another year.

348
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,291
I am just making sure you
study enough to avoid that.

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,377
That's it?

350
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,711
Yes, that's it.

351
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:54,216
I don't believe you.
You care that much about me?

352
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,427
I wouldn't normally do this.

353
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,639
I would rather focus on my own test.

354
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,766
Then why?

355
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,560
That really is Shinomiya.

356
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,897
What? No way.
Miss Kaguya and Ishigami together?

357
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,065
Why?

358
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,067
It's just one of those things, right?

359
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,527
I don't like it!

360
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,363
I've had enough of this.

361
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,910
I think that I don't particularly care
if I fall behind.

362
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:26,415
Besides, I made a mess of things
in middle school,

363
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,794
and you just saw
how they treat me like a blister.

364
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,380
I was originally a problem pupil
who wouldn't go to school.

365
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,967
If people see you studying
with a person like me,

366
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,804
it might start weird rumors
that would damage your reputation.

367
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,684
Well, all the noise is annoying
and it gets in the way of studying.

368
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:47,978
You people!

369
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,023
You should keep quiet in the library.

370
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,068
Or maybe you have something
that you want to tell me?

371
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,240
Well, that Ishigami...

372
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,160
It's best not to get involved with him.

373
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,246
We just worry about you, Miss Kaguya.

374
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,707
Thank you for your warning.

375
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,378
However, I don't judge people
based on the opinions of those around me.

376
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:19,092
I decided that Ishigami is a person
worthy enough to have a relationship with.

377
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,805
Or are you doubting my judgment?

378
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,315
I am happy that you defended me,
but it will be badly misunderstood.

379
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,692
That doesn't concern us.

380
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,196
The most important thing now
is that you don't get a failing grade.

381
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:43,158
I don't care who might misunderstand what.

382
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,117
But...

383
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,661
I told you, didn't I?

384
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,829
I promised you on my honor

385
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:52,459
that I won't let you fail, no matter what.

386
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,171
Besides, without you,
the president would be troubled.

387
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,678
If you understand, move your hand.

388
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,930
Okay.

389
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,184
Somehow,

390
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,229
they didn't seem to need me at all.

391
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:13,897
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

392
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:14,856
<i>The following day.</i>

393
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,943
The tests are over!

394
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,115
Shinomiya, I somehow managed
to avoid failing the test.

395
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:27,536
I think I misunderstood you a little.

396
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,454
Ishigami.

397
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,084
What is this score?

398
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,630
You almost failed the test, didn't you?

399
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,175
After I took so much time to teach you!

400
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,678
I tried pretty hard.

401
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:50,350
How dare you drag my face through the mud!

402
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,061
It's hopeless!
This person is scary after all!

403
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,525
That's how Shinomiya is.

404
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,112
She doesn't lie to herself.

405
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,532
If she promises to do something,
consider it done.

406
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,243
She will do anything to keep her promise,
that's how much she cares.

407
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,913
I also thought she was ruthless
at the beginning,

408
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,250
but when you notice
that side of her, well...

409
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,294
What happened after that?

410
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,629
Forget about it.

411
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,424
<i>It's an old story.</i>

412
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,259
<i>Today's result,</i>

413
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,219
<i>Shirogane lost.</i>

414
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,306
LITTLE ISHIGAMI
