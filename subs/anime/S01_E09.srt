1
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,309
The thunder gods
will steal my belly button!

2
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,812
{\an8}Are you that scared of lightning?

3
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,230
{\an8}Because it is so sudden.

4
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,190
{\an8}And then it goes, "boom!"

5
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,275
I hate loud sounds!

6
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,902
Then why don't you cover your ears?

7
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,530
If I use my hands for that,
they will steal my belly button!

8
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:58,243
It's logical if you think about it!

9
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,245
<i>What's logical about it?</i>

10
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,665
Local trains.

11
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,211
I will hide my belly button,
so please cover my ears, Kaguya.

12
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,796
Okay.

13
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,089
TRAIN SERVICES ARE CANCELLED

14
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,093
The trains are canceled
because of the typhoon!

15
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,928
That's not good.

16
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,805
You should call home.

17
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,307
My family doesn't have a car,
so they can't help me.

18
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,017
What will I do?

19
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,687
<i>I see.</i>

20
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,815
<i>I should offer to drive him home.</i>

21
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,984
President, if you'd like...

22
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,155
<i>Oh, that would be like... a driving date!</i>

23
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,115
<i>Driving date.</i>

24
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,617
<i>That is certainly also a kind of date.</i>

25
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,703
<i>Shoulders touching in a tight space,</i>

26
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,455
<i>listening to the pleasant FM radio,</i>

27
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,292
<i>driving through the city
while talking about this and that.</i>

28
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,961
<i>And then at a red light...</i>

29
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,963
<i>It would be so nice
if the light didn't turn green</i>

30
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,131
<i>and we could stay like this.</i>

31
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,466
<i>That's what she would think.</i>

32
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,970
<i>Strictly speaking, they wouldn't be alone
because Kaguya's driver is there,</i>

33
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,181
<i>but for Kaguya this would be a drive date.</i>

34
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,100
<i>In short...</i>

35
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,519
It hurts, that hurts!

36
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,648
<i>Then I would be inviting him on a date!</i>

37
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,442
-What's wrong, Shinomiya?
-Nothing.

38
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,944
Nothing at all.

39
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,322
<i>It would be better
if it came from the president.</i>

40
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>There's no way I can invite him like that.</i>

41
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:24,579
<i>But to let him find his way home
when he has no means of transportation...</i>

42
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,789
<i>That's right!</i>

43
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,126
<i>There would be no problem
if he would ask me to drop him off!</i>

44
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,256
It seems that my taxi is coming soon.

45
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,008
I see.

46
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,093
I'm screwed...

47
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,011
Eh?

48
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,472
Doesn't he have a way to go home?

49
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,307
It seems so.

50
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,309
Then let me drop...

51
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,728
A lightning stroke outside!

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,650
I will cover your ears
so you can't hear anything.

53
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,568
Thank you.

54
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,737
While I'm at it,
I will cover your eyes as well.

55
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,656
Why do you have to do that?

56
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,865
Well, then.

57
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,326
-I'll bring you to the taxi like this.
-Wait a minute, Kaguya!

58
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,203
It's scary!

59
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,247
But also, a little fun!

60
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,040
What game are they playing?

61
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,214
<i>Well, now that the most troublesome kid
has gone home,</i>

62
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,966
<i>I won't be bothered.</i>

63
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,427
<i>But how do I get him
to ask me to drop him off?</i>

64
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,180
This is bad,
I still have to go to my part-time job.

65
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,891
I will lose a shift if this continues.

66
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,810
That's right.

67
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,814
To miss a shift because of a typhoon
would disqualify you as a working adult.

68
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,609
You could either call a taxi
that costs as much as you earn per day,

69
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,153
or you could ask somebody to drop you off.

70
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,532
It's an obvious choice
for any true grown-up, right?

71
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,619
<i>This was efficient.</i>

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,997
I will think about it
on the way to the toilet.

73
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,957
Please do so.

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,458
<i>Is hard to imagine</i>

75
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,877
<i>that the cheapskate president
would call a cab.</i>

76
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:59,382
<i>Then, naturally, he would come
bowing to me as clear as day.</i>

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,636
<i>I won this round!</i>

78
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,180
Forty-five dollars.

79
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,600
With a salary of nine dollars per hour,
that means five hours of work.

80
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,353
But I don't want to miss my shift!

81
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,272
<i>Oh, no!</i>

82
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,815
<i>The trains are running again!</i>

83
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,650
<i>What's up with this timing?</i>

84
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,361
<i>Try a little harder, typhoon!</i>

85
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,158
<i>There's nothing else left to do but that.</i>

86
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,369
<i>The Seven Anti-Shirogane Measures,
number one.</i>

87
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,163
<i>The rechargeable battery is dead.</i>

88
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,999
<i>Kaguya always plans
for every possible situation.</i>

89
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,085
<i>She has prepared traps
to trick Shirogane with.</i>

90
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,296
<i>This rechargeable battery is one of them!</i>

91
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,507
<i>I have about a minute until
the president comes back from the toilet.</i>

92
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,469
<i>I have to change his battery in that time.</i>

93
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,307
<i>The time is very short
and the degree of difficulty is very high,</i>

94
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,934
{\an8}<i>but I can do it!</i>

95
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,200
What's wrong, Shinomiya?

96
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,745
Nothing, I'm doing a light exercise.

97
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,791
My battery died?

98
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,961
Hey, can I use your phone?

99
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,838
My car has also come to pick me up.

100
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,090
Excuse me.

101
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,926
See you tomorrow.

102
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,645
<i>If I just wait here...</i>

103
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,607
<i>Shinomiya, are you going back by car?</i>

104
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,275
<i>Please!</i>

105
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,860
<i>Can you give me a lift, please?</i>

106
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,906
Since you're asking so passionately,
I cannot refuse you.

107
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,742
I will bring the miserable president home.

108
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,244
Are you a god?

109
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,163
Ms. Kaguya.

110
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,541
That's quite a cute plan,

111
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,836
but how will I be able to go home?

112
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,546
By walking?

113
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,839
Are you a devil?

114
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,135
If you don't cherish me more,
you will get your punishment.

115
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,262
You with your punishments...

116
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,818
I told you.

117
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,486
I was kidding.

118
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,157
Of course,
I called a taxi for you, Hayasaka.

119
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,664
Damn it!

120
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,925
I also...

121
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,052
saw this coming.

122
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,098
Then you should have stopped me sooner.

123
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,726
I will skip school today, too.

124
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,769
I'll be back.
I'll just make you a porridge.

125
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,022
No!

126
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,816
Stay with me, Hayasaka!

127
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,861
It's too bad.
You're not usually this cute.

128
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,656
Shinomiya caught a cold?

129
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,744
<i>Continuing to the nerve-racking incident
of the home visit.</i>

130
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,872
<i>It's good! This phone
can do a lot of things. It's great!</i>

131
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,123
SHIROGANE'S SECOND-HAND
SMARTPHONE

132
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,500
WITH NO INSURANCE GOT A NEW BATTERY.

133
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,461
It seems that Shinomiya has caught a cold.

134
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,464
That means we have to bring her
the handouts.

135
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,799
I will go!

136
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,218
Secretary Fujiwara?

137
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,513
I only visited her when she was sick once.

138
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:39,101
When Kaguya is sick,
she totally acts like a pampered child!

139
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,728
<i>Pampered?</i>

140
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,688
<i>President, can you please wipe my back?</i>

141
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,192
She's really cute!

142
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:50,279
You know? You can hug her as much
as you want and she won't get mad.

143
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,242
<i>President, hug me tightly!</i>

144
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,537
But visiting her alone would be unfair.

145
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,497
Let's all go together.

146
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,790
All of us?

147
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,749
Yes.

148
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,962
Visiting a sick person in a large group
would be senseless.

149
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,548
I think it's enough if one person goes.

150
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,758
<i>I'm scared so I don't want to go.</i>

151
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,468
Well, that's true.

152
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,804
Who should go, then?

153
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,348
Let's decide by playing a memory game.

154
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,684
<i>Memory game.</i>

155
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,395
<i>As everyone knows, it's a common game.</i>

156
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,063
We won't use jokers.

157
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,984
And if someone is caught cheating,
he will lose five points, okay?

158
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,945
Let's decide who starts
with rock-paper-scissors.

159
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,157
President, start the game!

160
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,202
Let's start!

161
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,538
I caught you, Secretary Fujiwara!

162
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,207
What is it, President?

163
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,711
Well, there are several
frustrating things.

164
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,380
First is that you would challenge us
to a memory game.

165
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,465
That is a little strange
for this occasion.

166
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:55,011
Usually, you would pick a game
you are more skilled at.

167
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,221
Then you mentioned so nonchalantly

168
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,557
that anyone who cheats
should lose five points

169
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,642
instead of being instantly disqualified.

170
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,519
That made me cautious.

171
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,063
If you hadn't said anything,
I probably would have missed it.

172
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,485
What are these signs
that look like numbers?

173
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,115
These are playing cards for cheating!

174
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,367
Is that true?

175
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,494
Fujiwara, you're an underhanded
cheap shot!

176
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,497
Then you got caught
by the tactic you used to cheat!

177
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,166
You're so shameful!

178
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,667
That's so embarrassing!

179
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,336
If it were me, I would go home.

180
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,797
-Shame!
-That's enough, Ishigami.

181
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,759
We agreed on how to punish someone
who cheats

182
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,011
and this is behavior
is also within the rule.

183
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,638
It's fair because we only touched them.

184
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,972
That's right!

185
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,267
If I haven't been caught in the act,
then it's not cheating!

186
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,978
No, you were caught.

187
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,314
<i>Starting over.</i>

188
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,150
<i>In the first half of the game,
these corrupt but still talented players</i>

189
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,570
<i>correctly identified
the position of each card.</i>

190
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,406
<i>Making no mistakes,
they gathered all the points properly.</i>

191
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,701
<i>Shirogane earned ten points,
Fujiwara eight points,</i>

192
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,370
<i>and Ishigami earned ten points.</i>

193
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,121
<i>There are now 24 cards remaining.</i>

194
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,084
With this, I am in a tie with Ishigami.

195
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,587
<i>President, wipe the front, too. Please!</i>

196
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,714
As expected,

197
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,841
you all have a good memory.

198
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,511
So I'll make it a little harder for you!

199
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,470
What?

200
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,971
<i>Changing the location!</i>

201
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,432
<i>Moving the cards
they desperately tried to remember</i>

202
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,976
<i>is particularly a dirty strategy.</i>

203
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,936
POSITION CHANGE

204
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,146
<i>This is bad!
I don't know where they are anymore.</i>

205
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,401
<i>By changing the position of the cards,
Fujiwara earned significantly more points.</i>

206
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,736
<i>Finally, she got back the points
she lost by cheating.</i>

207
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,657
Now, enjoy the game, everybody!

208
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,203
<i>Oh, no. I'm last.</i>

209
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:48,249
<i>If this carries on, I won't get to
see Shinomiya being a pampered baby.</i>

210
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,377
<i>President, can you caress me?</i>

211
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,630
What gift should I bring her?

212
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,425
I rarely have a chance
to give her something!

213
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,512
She got too drenched last night,
it's no wonder she caught a cold.

214
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,931
Drenched? Shinomiya?

215
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,766
But she was driven home.

216
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,436
Well, I just happened to see her.

217
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,111
She was waiting for somebody
outside the school gate.

218
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,242
<i>Could she have been waiting for me?</i>

219
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,869
<i>I don't have any proof...</i>

220
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,123
<i>If that's true,</i>

221
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,334
<i>I shouldn't be thinking
about pampered Shinomiya.</i>

222
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,087
<i>I am idiot who thinks only
about stupid things.</i>

223
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,090
<i>In this case, it really should be me
who's going to visit her.</i>

224
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,801
<i>Don't think about stupid things!</i>

225
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,136
<i>Concentrate!</i>

226
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,929
Thirteen.

227
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,264
<i>Thirteen!</i>

228
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,476
<i>Damn it! If she wins,
she'll get to have this, too!</i>

229
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,979
It was false.

230
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,196
<i>Is this just a normal mistake?</i>

231
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,491
<i>No way!</i>

232
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,164
<i>I see!</i>

233
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,875
It's your turn, President!

234
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,793
Take this!

235
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,755
And this!

236
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,467
I win.

237
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,262
{\an8}<i>Conclusion, first place goes to Shirogane.</i>

238
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,474
That was some fierce catch-up!

239
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,560
Oh well, this is what happens
when you understand the trick.

240
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,520
The trick?

241
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,773
These cards are special

242
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,484
because the patterns on them
aren't symmetrical.

243
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,028
That's why you can use them like this.

244
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,451
That's right!
They look like numbers on a watch.

245
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,410
Yes.

246
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,414
If you place them at the right angle,
they can show the numbers one to twelve.

247
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,833
And the card number thirteen
was problematic,

248
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,127
so Fujiwara put it farthest away.

249
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,464
The position change
was also meant to hide this trick.

250
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,675
Fujiwara.

251
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,429
You're a cheater!

252
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,973
Underhanded! A cheater!

253
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,349
You don't learn at all!

254
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,642
You should be ashamed!

255
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,519
Where do you get such shamelessness?

256
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,604
And then he beat you
by discovering how you cheated?

257
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,064
That's the most embarrassing!

258
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,399
So shameful.

259
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,693
That is so shameful, Fujiwara!

260
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,986
Don't look at me!

261
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,322
I just...

262
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,659
I just wanted to visit Shinomiya!

263
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,287
I want to die, so I'm going home.

264
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,080
Is that so?

265
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,166
But please don't die!

266
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,547
And yet I somehow managed
to trick my sisters through that.

267
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,632
She really is a cheater!

268
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,843
Is that why they say that analog gamers

269
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,595
are superficial?

270
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,639
It's like she fell into her own trap.

271
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,142
<i>This happens when you do something
that doesn't suit you.</i>

272
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,061
<i>I wonder if this is how Shinomiya learned.</i>

273
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,105
<i>If it were Shinomiya...</i>

274
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,401
<i>Oh, crap. I'm getting a little nervous.</i>

275
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,904
<i>What should I give her?</i>

276
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:10,034
I want to eat canned peaches, Hayasaka.

277
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,368
Sure.

278
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,623
<i>The sickbed visit continues in part two.</i>

279
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,667
TODAY'S RESULT,

280
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,794
BOTH OF THEM LOST

281
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,172
{\an8}BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM HAD A STRATEGY.

282
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,181
<i>Is this the famous Shinomiya villa?</i>

283
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,851
<i>I saw it on the internet,
but it's even more amazing in real life.</i>

284
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>I probably should have brought
more than drinks and jelly.</i>

285
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:46,362
I am responsible
for the care of Ms. Kaguya.

286
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,906
My name is Smithee A. Hayasaka.

287
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,075
I am pleased to make your acquaintance.

288
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,703
COLORED CONTACTS

289
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,205
A LITTLE PADDED

290
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,457
<i>It's a maid!</i>

291
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,545
{\an8}I see you have come to visit
Ms. Kaguya on her sickbed.

292
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,798
{\an8}Oh, yes. That's right.

293
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,884
Then I will show you to her room, sir.

294
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,053
Oh, no. About that...

295
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,431
I only came to deliver
these handouts to Shinomiya.

296
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,559
If you could please
give these to her, Ms. Hayasaka.

297
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,770
Don't get spooked after you made it here.

298
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,732
There, there.

299
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,067
But, you know...

300
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,151
No, no.

301
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,279
I think it's best
if you give them directly to Ms. Kaguya.

302
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,239
But!

303
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,492
Ms. Kaguya,

304
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,453
you have a visitor.

305
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,792
Hey! What are you doing, Ms. Kaguya?

306
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,876
DIRTY!

307
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,462
I can't find it.

308
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,798
What are you looking for?

309
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,258
Fireworks.

310
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,300
Fireworks?

311
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,220
Let's light some fireworks
together, Hayasaka!

312
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,555
No, we won't.

313
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,268
I understand you get ahead of yourself
because summer vacation is coming soon,

314
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,353
but treating your cold is our priority.

315
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,274
You're a meanie! I want fireworks!

316
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,818
Never mind that,
there is a guest here for you.

317
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,319
A guest?

318
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,536
It's the president!

319
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,747
Why are you here?

320
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,331
Oh, well...

321
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,044
Are you living here now?
Why am I not aware of that?

322
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,920
No, I am not. I'm not living here!

323
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,423
Ms. Hayasaka, what's this?

324
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,383
According to Sigmund Freud,

325
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:37,473
human behavior
is determined by desire and reason.

326
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,935
The human instinct constantly
creates the id,

327
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,731
and the ego has the role
of controlling those desires.

328
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,857
However,

329
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,151
if one loses the ability to think

330
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,154
that is at the base
of the ego for some reason,

331
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,240
one becomes a beast controlled by our id.

332
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,119
In other words, you become an idiot.

333
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,079
An idiot?

334
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,623
People who usually use their brain
as much as possible

335
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,292
are most affected at times like these.

336
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,379
At first glance,
it seems like she's awake,

337
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,299
but she is like a person in a dream.

338
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,760
When she gets well,

339
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,472
all of her memories during the time
that she was sick will be gone.

340
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,307
It's the same as being drunk.

341
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,601
<i>There she goes,
saying strange things again.</i>

342
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,105
Well, I have to get back to work soon.

343
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,732
I'll leave Ms. Kaguya in your care.

344
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,067
I understand.

345
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,610
Is it all right?

346
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:36,240
Nobody will come into this room
for about three hours.

347
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,284
Under no circumstances
should you do anything strange.

348
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,370
I won't.

349
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,207
Additionally, this room
is completely soundproofed.

350
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,835
Ms. Kaguya won't remember anything,

351
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,337
if you did anything
you wouldn't get caught.

352
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:56,343
But you should absolutely
not do anything weird.

353
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,928
I'm telling you I won't!

354
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,190
I bought several drinks for you.

355
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,900
Do you want one?

356
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,819
Fireworks?

357
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,737
No, not fireworks.

358
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,072
<i>It's no use.</i>

359
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,826
<i>I can't talk to her
about anything serious right now.</i>

360
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,244
<i>Honestly speaking,</i>

361
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,122
<i>I was hoping I could help her drink
or do other wicked things,</i>

362
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,541
<i>but she really is weak.</i>

363
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,335
<i>If I took advantage of this,</i>

364
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,631
<i>I could find out what she really feels
or what her weakness is, but...</i>

365
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,552
Shinomiya.

366
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,138
Did you by any chance
get sick because of me?

367
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,767
Yesterday, you wanted
to give me a ride, right?

368
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,229
And that's why
you were waiting at the school gate.

369
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,440
I don't know.

370
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,402
It feels like it's true
but it also feels like it's not.

371
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,653
Which is?

372
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,282
Are you mad at me, President?

373
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,743
I am sorry.

374
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,870
No, you didn't do anything.

375
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,455
No.

376
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:11,001
I always cause you trouble.

377
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:17,257
You know, I never know what I should do.

378
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,385
It's my first time
being in this kind of situation,

379
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,929
so I really don't know what to do.

380
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:27,351
That's why I only do it
the only way I know how.

381
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,105
I don't know any other way to do it.

382
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,108
I can only do it like this.

383
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,903
That's why today...

384
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,493
let's sleep together.

385
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,495
What? No, Shinomiya!

386
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,582
Are you being shy?

387
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,127
How cute of you.

388
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,462
<i>Wait a little!</i>

389
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,756
<i>Shinomiya won't remember any of this</i>

390
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,758
<i>and nobody will come in this room.</i>

391
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,552
<i>This situation is too convenient!</i>

392
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,681
<i>I am not sure I can control myself!</i>

393
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,432
<i>Just what have I</i>

394
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,687
<i>gotten myself into?</i>

395
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,772
ID
EGO

396
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,651
{\an8}SLEEP-DEPRIVED

397
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,537
What time is it?

398
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,540
It feels like I've been sleeping
for a long time.

399
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,094
President!

400
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,263
Why are you in my bed?

401
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,307
I just came over...

402
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,019
What kind of man who slips
into a woman's bed without permission?

403
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,353
But you invited me!

404
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,855
There's no way I'd do that!

405
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,857
How dare you get in while I was sleeping!

406
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,816
You're the worst!

407
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,443
Get out of here!

408
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,741
Oh, my.
I thought it would turn out like this.

409
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,122
Well, it seems you had a good sleep.

410
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,082
Hayasaka!

411
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,293
How far did I go with him?

412
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,878
It's not for me to tell.

413
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,713
<i>How irritating!</i>

414
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,216
<i>It's so annoying that I can't stand it.
I tried so hard to hold it back!</i>

415
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,219
<i>The nerve-racking home visit incident
comes to a close.</i>

416
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,723
<i>Well, maybe you didn't do it.</i>

417
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,521
