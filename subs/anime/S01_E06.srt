1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,213
<i>Schuchiin Academy Campus,
High School Department.</i>

2
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:10,093
<i>The fourth member of the student council,
the accountant, Yu Ishigami</i>

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,850
{\an8}<i>While this man is indispensable
to the council,</i>

4
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,812
<i>we haven't let you
get a clear picture of him.</i>

5
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,565
{\an8}<i>The president of the Student Council,
is counting on his ability</i>

6
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:27,027
<i>so he was chosen to act as an accountant.</i>

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,446
This month's accounting report.

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:34,117
-Oh, what is it?
<i>-He is now waiting for an opportunity.</i>

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,995
I would like to quit the Student Council.

10
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,248
<i>He was about to quit the Student Council.</i>

11
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,591
I see. You want to quit the council.

12
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,804
{\an8}Please reconsider!

13
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,597
{\an8}We will collapse if you leave the council.

14
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,141
I mean it!

15
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,767
<i>Yu Ishigami.</i>

16
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,937
<i>He is an expert in data processing.</i>

17
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,607
<i>In the Shuchiin Academy, there is a system
in which only the president is elected</i>

18
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,653
<i>while all other members are appointed
based on their ability.</i>

19
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,614
<i>Even though
he was only a first year student,</i>

20
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,868
<i>he was already scouted as the president,
for he is an excellent, capable person.</i>

21
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,619
<i>Normally, he works at home,</i>

22
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>and is only present at briefing meetings,</i>

23
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,083
{\an8}<i>but he is a fully-fledged member
of the Student Council.</i>

24
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,837
{\an8}<i>He is, without a doubt,
the accountant of the Student Council.</i>

25
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:55,466
<i>-But he was going to quit the council.</i>
-But I have no other choice.

26
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,677
-The reason for that was...
<i>-The reason for that was...</i>

27
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,098
I think I will surely get killed.

28
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,391
Killed?

29
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,018
-By Shinomiya.
-Shinomiya?

30
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,020
I think she will kill me.

31
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,480
What makes you think that?

32
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,065
Her eyes.

33
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,026
Her eyes?

34
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,070
<i>People's eyeballs are an organ
directly connected to the brain.</i>

35
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:19,324
<i>Usually, half of the brain
is used for the sense of sight.</i>

36
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,411
<i>What people are afraid of,
or what people are starving for,</i>

37
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,539
<i>the brain activity
is shown clearly on the eye movement.</i>

38
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,833
When I see people's eyes,

39
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,170
I understand five or six percent
of their true nature.

40
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,922
Those are strange numbers!

41
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,090
Even I can understand that much.

42
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,553
Shinomiya is sometimes looking at me
with terrible eyes.

43
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,514
She, undoubtedly, wants to kill me.

44
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,808
Just what are you saying happened?

45
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,937
It happened last month.

46
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,655
BRAND COFFEE FOR FREE

47
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:05,787
Just as I thought, aren't there
many people who find it best to kill time?

48
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,871
<i>What is this?</i>

49
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,290
We can't really go to a coffee shop.

50
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,793
That would get pretty expensive.

51
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,211
That's right.

52
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,004
It would be great

53
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,756
if we had discount coupons for someplace.

54
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,717
NONSENSE

55
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,843
That's right.

56
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,264
Well, as long as it's cheap,
we could go there from time to time.

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,361
Don't tell anyone about those tickets.

58
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,614
<i>What was that?</i>

59
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,741
She threatened me,
that's why I can't tell you.

60
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,951
Threatened?

61
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,037
I believe she has already killed
two or three people already.

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,163
What happened?

63
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,458
Also, last week...

64
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,672
Shinomiya, do you like the president?

65
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,048
WRONG ANSWER

66
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,342
What did you say? I like the president?

67
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,969
Please, don't say stupid things.

68
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,429
There's no way I would like him.

69
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,348
Don't you think he's boyfriend material?

70
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,643
What? Of course not...

71
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,353
Really?

72
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,274
I'm really bothered
by being the subject of such rumors!

73
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,984
<i>Is that so?</i>

74
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,737
<i>I thought you looked good together.</i>

75
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,282
Then, I will go to the president
and tell all of that in your place.

76
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,825
I'll say that it's hopeless.

77
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,541
Don't you dare tell him that.

78
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,168
Do you understand that?

79
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,673
I think she can go so far
as having me assassinated.

80
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,924
Assassinated?

81
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,343
Using the sofa corner
to attack and strangle me

82
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,386
was a professional move.

83
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,847
Just who do you think Shinomiya is?

84
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,933
I think she likely has
the nature of a serial killer.

85
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,019
You can see it in her eyes.

86
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,229
<i>Isn't he too confident
considering his lack of accuracy?</i>

87
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,107
<i>Fujiwara is in even more danger than I am.</i>

88
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,319
<i>She sometimes looks at her
as if she wasn't even human.</i>

89
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,946
<i>I think she's got
less than two months to live.</i>

90
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,573
<i>You've already done the calculations?</i>

91
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,533
<i>Don't be stupid!</i>

92
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,871
No, people like her
are the most dangerous.

93
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:12,830
President?

94
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,084
Have you seen Ishigami?

95
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,837
The conference earlier...

96
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,964
Don't make it worse for yourself!

97
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,883
It's regarding the budget
of the drama club.

98
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,843
Surrender yourself, Shinomiya!

99
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,386
Hey!

100
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,347
Listen to me first!

101
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,104
Didn't I tell you that the drama club
needs some assistance?

102
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,314
They are fitting the costume today.

103
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,941
Yes.

104
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:44,070
Even so, you didn't need
to bring that prop with you.

105
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,655
Well...

106
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,534
That is because
I was in the mood for a little prank.

107
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,495
I am sorry.

108
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,412
<i>She's cute.</i>

109
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,124
Shirogane, this is a trap.

110
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,459
She is acting cute,

111
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,586
so you'll let your guards down
then she'll cut you up.

112
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,589
Don't say scary things.

113
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,009
That is just a costume,
Shinomiya wouldn't kill anyone!

114
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,637
President!

115
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,849
Please, help me.

116
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,229
Kaguya killed me off!

117
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,189
As I thought!

118
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,899
Just what are you thinking?

119
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,734
It's just a special makeup.

120
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,445
Oh, that's right.

121
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,946
No, President.

122
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,364
This is also a trap.

123
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,324
Maybe she really died,

124
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,952
and Shinomiya performed
a creepy operation on her.

125
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,745
Accountant Ishigami.

126
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,373
You always think too much.

127
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,543
Shinomiya would never kill anybody.

128
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,297
Try to believe more in your friends, okay?

129
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,676
Believe in friends?

130
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,636
That's amazing, by the way.

131
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,804
Right?

132
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,681
How did you apply it?

133
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,100
Just like this!

134
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,227
I am sorry.

135
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,606
Believe in friends.

136
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,857
Ishigami?

137
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,277
About that matter...

138
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,949
I am happy
you didn't talk to anyone about it.

139
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,327
It's a virtue
to be able to keep your mouth shut.

140
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,370
Next time, if you talk...

141
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,334
<i>Believe?</i>

142
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,380
I wouldn't be using this toy knife, okay?

143
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,886
Also, please stop bothering the president.

144
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,972
Don't talk about quitting
the council anymore, okay?

145
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,850
-Will you also stab the president?
-<i>What if she...</i>

146
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,228
-Is it okay? I want to try it, too!
-<i>by any chance...</i>

147
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,607
<i>was listening from the start?</i>

148
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,200
<i>Today's result...</i>

149
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,743
ISHIGAMI WANTED TO QUIT BUT HE CAN'T
BECAUSE HE WAS SCARED OF KAGUYA

150
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,120
<i>...Ishigami lost.</i>

151
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,040
THE WOMAN OF LOVE AND HATE

152
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,627
You are seeing different animal cages.

153
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,880
How many cats can fit into that one?

154
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,175
{\an8}Why are you asking me
such an abstract question?

155
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,427
{\an8}It's a psychological test.

156
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,346
{\an8}I borrowed this from the library.

157
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,848
Just by answering these questions,

158
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,435
I can get a clear and comprehensive image
of your deep psyche.

159
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,395
That's worthless.

160
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,399
You think you can understand people
just by asking these questions?

161
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,234
Well, let's just try it anyway.

162
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,194
How many cats?

163
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,906
I think about nine cats?

164
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,786
This is the number of kids
you want to have.

165
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,956
<i>Amazing! It's on point!</i>

166
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,209
-Nine! That's a large family!
<i>-Nine! That many?</i>

167
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,752
<i>Psychological test.</i>

168
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,131
<i>A test that draws out a person's
true nature with abstract questions.</i>

169
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:54,135
{\an8}<i>Many elements of the game have cited
a strong influence of the Barnum effect.</i>

170
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,805
{\an8}<i>But among those, there are also practical
results based on psychology.</i>

171
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,683
<i>This test has brought painful experiences</i>

172
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,686
<i>when people thought about it
entirely as a game and were negligent.</i>

173
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,273
There are many
other interesting questions.

174
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,150
Let's play it together.

175
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,569
Do you want us to join, too?

176
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,486
Yes.

177
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,865
Ready, everyone?

178
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,201
You are walking on a gloomy road.

179
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,496
And somebody taps your shoulder
from behind.

180
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,373
Who do you think it is?

181
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,335
Give me another hint.

182
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,004
It's not a quiz so
it doesn't work like that.

183
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:30,963
I see.

184
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,590
A gloomy road.

185
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,967
Just what is that suggesting?

186
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,387
<i>I know it!</i>

187
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,432
<i>It's the second question on page 47!
The answer to that is...</i>

188
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,852
<i>it is the person that you like!</i>

189
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,188
<i>If you said the name
of the person you like,</i>

190
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,690
<i>it's would turn out like a confession.</i>

191
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,527
<i>As usual, she was prepared
for this situation as well.</i>

192
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,031
<i>She was friends with Chika Fujiwara
since childhood.</i>

193
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,659
<i>Kaguya knows her behavioral patterns well.</i>

194
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,162
<i>Ever since she saw the book
has been added to the library,</i>

195
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>she guessed that it was very likely
for Fujiwara to bring it to the council.</i>

196
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,835
<i>Kaguya thoroughly checked that book.</i>

197
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,836
Question!

198
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,421
You found a squirrel.

199
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,174
<i>-She could avoid dangerous answers.</i>
-What do you do with it?

200
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,926
Let me see.

201
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,971
I would cook for her every day
and massage her before she goes to sleep.

202
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,723
The answer is...

203
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,602
that is how would you treat your partner
after marrying him.

204
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,437
<i>In other words,</i>

205
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,065
<i>when it comes to the minefield
of this psychological test,</i>

206
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,693
<i>she had a great advantage.</i>

207
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,655
That's right. My answer is you, Fujiwara.

208
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,116
What? Me?

209
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,745
<i>A gloomy road...</i>

210
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,801
Why are you running away, Ishigami?

211
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,720
For me... it was Shinomiya.

212
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,930
Me?

213
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,682
<i>Is that how he feels?</i>

214
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,644
<i>He's a good kid
and it's not like I hate him, but...</i>

215
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,104
<i>I am sorry.</i>

216
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:13,023
<i>I can only think of him
about as much as I do of a cricket.</i>

217
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,733
<i>Ishigami was rejected.</i>

218
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,279
<i>Well, the problem is the president.</i>

219
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,909
<i>Kaguya is cold and scared,
she doesn't like this.</i>

220
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,455
<i>President, let's go back together.</i>

221
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,250
That's true. I am...

222
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,251
Now.

223
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,335
<i>Wait!</i>

224
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,504
<i>Why is she smiling like that?</i>

225
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,924
<i>She said it's an interesting question.</i>

226
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,510
<i>What that romantic brain of hers
is interested in</i>

227
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,804
<i>can't be a proper test.</i>

228
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,599
<i>What if the answer to that is
the person you like?</i>

229
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,809
<i>Well, President.</i>

230
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,480
<i>Deep down you always liked
me very much, right?</i>

231
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,191
<i>How cute of you!</i>

232
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,319
<i>That would be like confessing my feelings!</i>

233
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,406
<i>I have to pick someone with whom
I have a relationship they approve of.</i>

234
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,908
Then...

235
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,203
That would be my sister, probably.

236
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,626
The person who tapped your shoulder
is the one you like.

237
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,504
In other words,
you have a sister complex, President.

238
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,339
You're the most boring among us.

239
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,049
Yes, I have a complex.

240
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,471
<i>I like Shinomiya?</i>

241
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,355
<i>Why does it feel terrible?</i>

242
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:39,735
President, I am suffering from
the Stockholm Syndrome so I am going home.

243
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,863
Take care.

244
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,367
It probably coincides
with misattribution of arousal.

245
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,577
I am going to the hospital.

246
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,997
I want to answer questions, too,
so let's search some on the internet.

247
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,040
<i>Damn it!</i>

248
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,876
<i>Fujiwara will pick some questions
outside of the book!</i>

249
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,419
Oh, this is cute!

250
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,382
<i>You are now on a broad field of flowers.</i>

251
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,387
The person who owns it told you
to pick as many flowers you as like.

252
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,722
How many do you pick?

253
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,475
<i>It's a question of which you don't know
what the answer symbolizes.</i>

254
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,102
Flowers?

255
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,356
<i>I would pick beautiful flowers
and cherish them.</i>

256
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,358
<i>I wouldn't need a lot of them.</i>

257
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,403
<i>I would pick enough</i>

258
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,656
<i>to make a flower bouquet
that I would love.</i>

259
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,575
I see.

260
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,868
<i>What should I do?</i>

261
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,619
<i>I answered without noticing.</i>

262
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,373
How many would you pick, President?

263
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,752
<i>Well, it's the same system as before.
So maybe I should answer it normally.</i>

264
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,714
You can pick flowers you like for free?

265
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,632
Then my answer can
only definitely be this one.

266
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,844
I would fill a truck with flowers
and drive it away.

267
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,139
I think the truck
wouldn't be enough either.

268
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,683
You have a poor person's mentality.

269
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,603
What would you do with so many flowers?

270
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,690
-It would be easy to give or sell them.
-<i>The answer is...</i>

271
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,193
THE QUANTITY OF FLOWERS YOU PICKED
SHOWS HOW MUCH YOU LOVE SOMEBODY

272
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,166
What was the answer?

273
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,961
It was how much you love flowers.

274
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,838
That was about it.

275
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,383
-But I love flowers!
-<i>That's stupid.</i>

276
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,885
I don't agree with this.

277
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,178
That's true.

278
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,013
-<i>Today's result,</i>
-But that's what it says.

279
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,474
-<i>Shirogane lost.</i>
-So you have to accept it.

280
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,143
<i>COST OF A FAMILY</i>

281
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,269
IF YOU GET THE HCG VACCINE
THERE IS A 20% CHANCE YOU WILL HAVE TWINS

282
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,606
Should we get a smoothie on the way home?

283
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,316
Okay!

284
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,651
I want a celery one.

285
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,527
What should we do?

286
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,239
I am sorry!

287
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,076
I need to work part-time today.
I have to go straight there?

288
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,452
Again?

289
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,079
You work too much.

290
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,206
You're definitely coming next time!

291
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,666
Sure!

292
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,630
It's time to go home, Ms. Kaguya.

293
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,632
Hayasaka.

294
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,343
I told you not to come
to the Student Council room.

295
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,305
{\an8}I checked first if the president
and the others have gone home.

296
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,431
{\an8}Please, relax.

297
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,267
{\an8}This kind of negligence is fatal.

298
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,105
You haven't been paying attention lately.

299
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,815
Those clothes,

300
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,902
the nails and your skirt's length
are all violating the school regulations.

301
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,697
They're all within school regulations.

302
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,325
Well, there are several loopholes
in the school regulation.

303
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,743
Several?

304
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,997
For us, beauty is power.

305
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,958
BEAUTY IS POWER

306
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,628
People who don't beautify themselves
don't belong in high society.

307
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,464
I don't want my chance to be stolen
by a woman who is only pretty.

308
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,551
And you are too formal, Ms. Kaguya.

309
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,763
Even in this high school,
nail polish has gotten popular lately.

310
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,474
If you want boys to think you are cute,

311
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,184
you should develop
a taste for such things.

312
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,644
Really?

313
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,104
If I did that, the president...

314
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,397
No,

315
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,691
the boys would think I am cute?

316
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,403
You have been wearing
such tattered clothes so far.

317
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,572
Of course.

318
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:15,826
<i>Hayasaka realized that nail polish
didn't much matter with the opposite sex.</i>

319
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,744
<i>However...</i>

320
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,203
For boys...

321
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,331
Anyway, let's get back quickly
and paint those nails.

322
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,752
-<i>The desire to dress Kaguya stylishly...</i>
-How do you mean?

323
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,587
-<i>Influenced her answer.</i>
-What is it?

324
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,381
NEXT DAY

325
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,302
<i>They used a kind of nail polish
that wouldn't violate the dress code.</i>

326
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,890
<i>The limestone painted on the ring finger
has an appeal to modesty.</i>

327
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,977
<i>What will the president think?</i>

328
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,604
<i>Will he think it's cute?</i>

329
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,192
<i>Or... maybe he will think
I'm being shallow?</i>

330
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,987
<i>What are you intending to do?
What's with those nails?</i>

331
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,864
<i>They're just nice.</i>

332
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,495
<i>I would hate it if he asked me like that.</i>

333
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,791
<i>I'll go home today, after all.</i>

334
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,958
What are you doing, Shinomiya?

335
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,628
Aren't you going in?

336
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,589
No, I am going in.

337
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,052
Kaguya!

338
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,888
I have a question about this part.

339
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,724
Yes, what is it?

340
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,812
Are you hiding something behind your back?

341
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,855
No, nothing at all.

342
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,276
<i>She always has good intuition
in times like this.</i>

343
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,862
<i>If someone were to notice,
I want it to be the president.</i>

344
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,156
<i>Even if it's wrong,
I don't want this kid to notice.</i>

345
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,158
<i>I have to get closer to him.</i>

346
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:43,038
President, this is a record
of the proceedings of the other day.

347
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,832
Thank you.

348
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,922
This part here is the problem.

349
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,716
That's right.

350
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,802
It's a big problem.

351
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,096
You are right!

352
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,308
<i>He didn't notice!</i>

353
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,270
<i>Shinomiya is getting fashionable!</i>

354
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,063
<i>Why didn't he notice?</i>

355
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,357
<i>Does this mean he is not interested in me?</i>

356
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,192
<i>Why did she change her attitude?</i>

357
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,319
<i>She always says,
"Does a swan need to dress up?"</i>

358
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,864
<i>She never paid attention to fashion.</i>

359
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,825
<i>What should I do?
Is this something I can allude to?</i>

360
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,035
You have a body fit for bearing children.

361
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,831
<i>Wouldn't that be considered
a matter of sexual harassment?</i>

362
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,040
<i>Also, lately...</i>

363
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,459
<i>Kei, isn't that skirt too short?</i>

364
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,296
<i>It's not like
I was showing it to you, bro.</i>

365
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,756
<i>And that's sexual harassment, by the way.</i>

366
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,676
<i>I was just worried about her as a brother.</i>

367
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,096
<i>Anyone's reaction,
except for the person that you want,</i>

368
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,307
<i>has a tendency
to be considered as sexual harassment.</i>

369
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,727
<i>However, I should at least
let her know that I noticed.</i>

370
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,814
<i>She probably won't insult me
worse than my sister did.</i>

371
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,610
Fujiwara.

372
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,864
You changed your conditioner, right?

373
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,116
You noticed that?

374
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,659
Oh, well.

375
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,370
The smell is different than usual.

376
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,876
Today, you could say that it's stuffy,

377
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,712
but it smells adorable than usual.

378
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,505
If I were to compare
it to your smell before,

379
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,715
it's like a baby's smell.

380
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,218
Ishigami.

381
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,303
That's creepy.

382
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,765
<i>I want to die...</i>

383
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,396
I want to die, so I will go home.

384
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,941
Okay, but don't die.

385
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,195
I wanted to compliment her,

386
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,113
because it smelled nice.

387
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,492
Do I smell? Is it bad?

388
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,785
<i>That was harsh!</i>

389
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,372
<i>The day Shinomiya tells me I am creepy,
I will also want to die!</i>

390
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,416
<i>I think, it's best
not to mention the nails.</i>

391
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,252
<i>The risk is too high.</i>

392
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,170
<i>I don't want to look creepy.</i>

393
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,967
<i>No. Is this also an excuse?</i>

394
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,845
<i>This is my problem.</i>

395
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,723
<i>Complimenting her nails is...</i>

396
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,434
<i>I simply...</i>

397
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,479
<i>I feel embarrassed.</i>

398
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,616
<i>In the end, he didn't notice my nails.</i>

399
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,787
<i>But I think it's better
that he didn't notice.</i>

400
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:34,126
<i>As I thought,
there's no point in dressing up stylishly.</i>

401
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,131
<i>I won't become cute.</i>

402
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,842
Shinomiya!

403
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,929
Those nails!

404
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:55,314
They're...

405
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,524
No, nothing at all.

406
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,861
What was it?

407
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,529
Tell me, please!

408
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:05,866
He wanted to say that you are cute.

409
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,373
<i>She also thinks he's cute.</i>

410
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,876
What was he trying to say?

411
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,797
What do you think, Hayasaka? Hayasaka!

412
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,677
-Did he notice them?
-<i>Today's result, Kaguya won.</i>

413
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,728
