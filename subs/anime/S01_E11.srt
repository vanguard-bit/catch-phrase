1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,339
Got you!

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,300
<i>Summer is the season for love.</i>

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,469
Hey, cut it out!

4
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:17,058
<i>Is it because the mischievous sun
turns a young girl's skin golden brown?</i>

5
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,981
<i>Or is it because we're blinded
by the mirage we see on hot asphalt?</i>

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,318
<i>Summer open the hearts of boys and girls</i>

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,864
<i>and helps them take their relationships
to the next level.</i>

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,243
<i>The summer holidays have begun...</i>

9
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,079
<i>And it's already been two weeks!</i>

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>Nothing exciting
has happened for this guy.</i>

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,002
AUGUST 14TH (WED)

12
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,045
I messed up.

13
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,007
I messed up real bad.

14
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,475
23: SHOPPING
24: FIREWORKS

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,936
Was that a sigh?

16
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,814
{\an8}If you sigh like that,

17
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,067
{\an8}happiness will drift away like the clouds.

18
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,199
Chairman Shirogane says he is at home.

19
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,618
If you wander around here
you are likely to meet him.

20
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,204
Hayasaka, why are you saying
such silly things?

21
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,040
As if I would act like a stalker...

22
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,460
Did you just say he was home?

23
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,588
Hayasaka, since when
have you been in contact

24
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,881
with the Chairman?

25
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,591
It's not what you think.

26
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,593
He sent out a tweet.

27
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,011
Twitter?

28
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,512
What is that?

29
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,347
Wait, I've heard of that.

30
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,643
So Fujiwara is on Twitter?

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,148
-Twitter?
-I'm going to take a bath.

32
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,190
RESERVED

33
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,817
Again?

34
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,569
Why is she allowed to do that?

35
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,089
Here we go.

36
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,299
SPLASH

37
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,967
GUSH

38
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,358
Hayasaka come with me right now!

39
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,776
What is it?

40
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,986
The internet is broken!

41
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,696
That's a serious problem.

42
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:03,034
I tried to use
that thing called Twitter but...

43
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,703
{\an8}The text is all warped.

44
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,747
That's not a problem.

45
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,583
Should I use the same password
as my bank account?

46
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,709
No.

47
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,211
<i>Internet illiterate.</i>

48
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,798
<i>Kaguya is an analog person.</i>

49
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,509
<i>She relies on mental arithmetic
rather than using a calculator.</i>

50
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,805
<i>Instead of using Google,
she uses a map or encyclopedia.</i>

51
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,059
<i>She only uses the internet
to check the weather and news.</i>

52
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,770
<i>So she only uses the top page
of the search engine.</i>

53
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,900
Her internet skills are at the same level
as the old man who owns the candy store.

54
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,527
Is this okay?

55
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,739
Yes. Ms. Kaguya, you have an account now.

56
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,618
I printed out a list of the accounts
of the Student Council members.

57
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,037
This is the secretary's account.

58
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,543
She spends most of her time tweeting
and not studying at all.

59
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,962
All she does is travel abroad.

60
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,798
This icon is...

61
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,341
Not interested.

62
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,262
Try playing around with it
and get accustomed to using it.

63
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,471
Okay.

64
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,349
I'm going back to taking my bath.

65
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,106
Gosh.

66
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,484
This job is so exhausting.

67
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,697
The only thing that keeps me going
is washing away my stress like this.

68
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,117
Ms. Kaguya doesn't understand.

69
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,412
She should appreciate me more.

70
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,081
Hayasaka! Come quick!

71
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:32,999
Jeez.

72
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,626
Ms. Kaguya stop barging in...

73
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,962
I've been banned from Twitter!

74
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,007
I'm surprised that you even know
about getting banned.

75
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,010
{\an8}Look, I can't see anything!

76
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,596
Why? What have I done wrong?

77
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,682
Chairman Shirogane has a private account.

78
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,100
Private account?

79
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,479
<i>There are always trolls
who post hateful comments.</i>

80
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,899
<i>The Chairman has a high level
of internet literacy.</i>

81
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:02,737
<i>I also keep my main account private.
You should be careful, too.</i>

82
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,072
In other words,

83
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,449
think of your account as your house.

84
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,536
<i>With a normal account,
it's like having your front door wide open</i>

85
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,246
<i>where guests can come and go
as they please.</i>

86
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,917
<i>But people who are cautious
lock their front doors</i>

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,753
<i>and give the keys
only to the people that they trust.</i>

88
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,549
Where can you get the key?

89
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,675
That's easy.

90
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,844
Just click on "Follow."

91
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:31,099
Chairman Shirogane will receive
an approval request.

92
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,227
When you get approved,
you'll be able to read his tweets.

93
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,606
He'll approve if your profile shows
that you're a student at Shuchiin.

94
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,859
I could never...

95
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,278
Do such a thing!

96
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,322
That would be like saying...

97
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,536
Chairman, open the door!

98
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,163
I want to know more about you!

99
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:59,252
{\an8}I want to know what you're thinking
and doing every day.

100
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,047
You want to know about me that badly?

101
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,844
The fact that you're obsessed
with my 140-character messages...

102
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,390
How cute.

103
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,558
APPROVAL

104
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,892
That's what approval is, right?

105
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,686
This is a whole new level of stupidity.

106
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,189
You're always thinking of useless things.

107
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,650
Hayasaka, are you mad at me?

108
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,444
I'm not mad but...

109
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,988
I'm wondering how long do you want
to keep me half-naked?

110
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,614
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,032
If you're not going to do it...

112
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,200
Wait! Hold on!

113
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,326
Hold on!

114
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,454
Let me do it when I'm ready!

115
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,967
FOLLOW

116
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,888
<i>I wonder what the Chairman tweets about?</i>

117
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,141
<i>What does he do? What does he like?</i>

118
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,935
<i>And how is he enjoying his summer?</i>

119
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,856
<i>But...</i>

120
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,649
<i>But...</i>

121
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,490
Right! I'm also making my account private.

122
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,991
When the Chairman follows me...

123
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,367
Please, wake up.

124
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,871
Nobody succeeds that way.

125
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,878
She wasn't able to ask for approval.

126
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:28,132
Ms. Kaguya is so stubborn
and I can't do anything about it.

127
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,093
They are both helpless.

128
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,596
If they could be more open
about their feelings,

129
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,306
they could easily find happiness.

130
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,267
But I envy them though.

131
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,813
I wish I could love somebody like that.

132
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,613
As if...

133
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,615
Hayasaka! Come quick!

134
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,285
<i>No decision on today's match.</i>

135
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,288
BECAUSE KAGUYA AND SHIROGANE
NEVER SAW EACH OTHER

136
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,124
That's enough!

137
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,586
SHE'S EXTREMELY FAST AT TYPING

138
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,173
{\an8}CHIKA FUJIWARA IS VERY HUNGRY

139
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,467
{\an8}Back in Japan!

140
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,220
Egypt was so fun.

141
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,432
I wish I could've stayed a little longer.

142
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,061
The <i>ta'ameya</i> and <i>kushari</i>
were so delicious!

143
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,480
All you're talking about is food.

144
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,941
You might have had fun

145
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:30,528
but I wanted to come back
to Japan as soon as possible.

146
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,822
Why?

147
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,407
Because...

148
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,498
<i>My name is Saburo Odajima.</i>

149
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,792
<i>I'm an insignificant mid-level manager.</i>

150
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,420
<i>My hobby is going to ramen restaurants.</i>

151
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,756
HAKATA TENRYU RAMEN

152
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,718
Welcome.

153
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,221
<i>I went to a local spot today.</i>

154
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,725
<i>The most popular item
is the</i> tonkotsu <i>ramen...</i>

155
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,310
<i>But that's not what I'm getting.</i>

156
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,437
<i>I'll order the least inconspicous
ramen at the end.</i>

157
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,521
<i>SHOYU TONKOTSU RAMEN</i>

158
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,274
<i>Shoyu tonkotsu</i> with a light broth.

159
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,817
How do you want your noodles?

160
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,818
Firm.

161
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,530
This is the optimal combination here.

162
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,616
<i>It's what a true ramen connoisseur orders.</i>

163
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,533
Welcome.

164
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,910
Wow! It smells so good.

165
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,872
<i>Well, what a cute customer.</i>

166
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,541
<i>Did she mistake this place
for a cake shop?</i>

167
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,709
What would you like?

168
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,085
I would like...

169
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,379
<i>Shoyu tonkotsu</i> with a light broth.

170
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,465
<i>What? Impossible!</i>

171
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,719
<i>How could such a young girl
have known the optimal combination?</i>

172
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,804
<i>Coincidence?</i>

173
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:44,727
<i>This isn't the kind of place that a girl
would visit alone late at night.</i>

174
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,396
<i>Is this girl...</i>

175
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,732
<i>One of us?</i>

176
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,192
THE CHOSEN ONES

177
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,818
How would you like your noodles?

178
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,195
Well...

179
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,488
Super firm.

180
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,282
<i>Super firm?</i>

181
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,869
<i>She's just following what's trendy.</i>

182
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,829
<i>She's just a young girl after all...</i>

183
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,122
<i>I was unnecessarily worried.</i>

184
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,917
<i>I overestimated her.</i>

185
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,543
Here you go.

186
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,045
<i>Well then...</i>

187
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,465
<i>I'll have to show her
the real way to eat ramen.</i>

188
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,802
<i>First, smell the fragrance of the soup.</i>

189
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,056
<i>The pickled ginger
has the strongest scent,</i>

190
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,475
<i>so you start diagonally from the ginger.</i>

191
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,104
<i>The owner is fully aware of that.</i>

192
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,650
<i>That's why he always place the ginger
the farthest away from the customer.</i>

193
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,276
<i>Next, taste the soup.</i>

194
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,946
<i>Mix in some air while you taste it.</i>

195
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,368
<i>I fully use my sense of smell and taste
to enjoy the flavor.</i>

196
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,581
<i>Next, the noodles.</i>

197
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,420
<i>I take a small amount
and enjoy the texture in my mouth.</i>

198
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,337
Here you go.

199
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,799
Thank you for the meal!

200
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,218
<i>Finally, the chaser.</i>

201
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,554
<i>In order to enjoy the subtle flavors,</i>

202
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,307
<i>you should wash away the oil and salt
from your tongue and reset your palette.</i>

203
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,227
<i>It makes a huge difference
when you do this.</i>

204
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,770
<i>This is one cycle.</i>

205
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,774
<i>We repeat this cycle
which is called</i> mizumawashi.

206
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,402
<i>How is the young girl doing?</i>

207
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,613
<i>Mini ramen!</i>

208
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,491
<i>-She's just a young girl after all.
-Twirl, twirl, twirl.</i>

209
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,165
<i>It looks so delicious.</i>

210
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,626
<i>I can't make fun of her technique.</i>

211
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,754
<i>You can taste all the flavors
at once with the mini ramen.</i>

212
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,091
<i>It is the ultimate form
of "all is one, one is all."</i>

213
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,760
<i>-Eating like that takes time
-Twirl, twirl, twirl.</i>

214
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,220
<i>and the noodles turn soft...</i>

215
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,181
<i>Soft noodles?</i>

216
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,474
<i>Super firm!</i>

217
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,434
-<i>That's why she chose super firm!
-Super firm!</i>

218
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,312
<i>She calculated the time it takes
for the noodles to get soft?</i>

219
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,355
<i>Slurp.</i>

220
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,734
<i>The small toppings are perfect
to make a mini ramen.</i>

221
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,818
<i>It can't be!</i>

222
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,778
<i>If she calculated all of this,
she could be</i>

223
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,238
<i>one of the "four kings."</i>

224
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,824
<i>Mashima Shima from Jimbochyo.</i>

225
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,367
<i>The Hermit from Sugamo.</i>

226
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,661
<i>Or J. Suzuki from Koenji.</i>

227
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,580
THE FOUR KINGS OF TOKYO RAMEN

228
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:15,211
<i>She has the same level
of skills as that of the top ramen pros!</i>

229
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,338
SAN-CHAN FROM SHIBUYA

230
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,881
<i>Wait a second.</i>

231
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,091
<i>That's right. Not yet.</i>

232
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,259
<i>Sadly,</i>

233
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,179
<i>there is a barrier
that women can't overcome.</i>

234
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,597
<i>That is...</i>

235
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,474
-<i>garlic!
-Garlic!</i>

236
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,768
<i>If you can't stand the smell of garlic,</i>

237
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,437
<i>then you're not a true ramen eater.</i>

238
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,273
<i>-You're a fake.
-You're a fake.</i>

239
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,406
<i>She ate all of the ingredients.</i>

240
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,574
<i>What will she do?</i>

241
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,826
<i>She can't make mini ramen anymore.</i>

242
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,995
<i>What will she do?</i>

243
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,580
<i>Is she going for it?</i>

244
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,541
<i>Is she going to do it?</i>

245
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,044
CRUNCH

246
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,921
<i>She did it!</i>

247
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,591
<i>She overcame the gender barrier!</i>

248
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,511
<i>I tip my hat to her.</i>

249
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,971
<i>She deserves respect.</i>

250
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,223
<i>She's one of the chosen ones.</i>

251
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,725
<i>She's a true ramen eater!</i>

252
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>No way!</i>

253
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,899
<i>She's drinking all the soup?</i>

254
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,278
<i>That's too much salt!</i>

255
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,572
<i>There's garlic in there, too!</i>

256
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,826
<i>But...</i>

257
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,579
<i>-I was young, too.
-It looks so delicious!</i>

258
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,914
<i>-I could do that then, too.
-Thank you for the meal.</i>

259
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:39,587
<i>Why did I become an old man?</i>

260
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,548
GULP

261
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,174
<i>Go for it!</i>

262
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:48,053
-<i>The radiant youth that I lost!</i>
-I'm so hungry!

263
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,226
<i>Finish the bowl!</i>

264
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,022
SOUP'S ALL GONE

265
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,568
Thanks for the meal!

266
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,863
Hey...

267
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,200
GOOD JOB

268
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,497
<i>Results of today's ramen match,</i>

269
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,666
<i>Fujiwara is the winner.</i>

270
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,169
WHERE'S YOUR SWITCH

271
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,421
My ramen switch is on!

272
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,717
<i>The summer holidays have begun...</i>

273
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,762
<i>And three weeks have passed.</i>

274
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,807
<i>Nothing exciting
has happened for this guy.</i>

275
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:38,896
<i>Every day I study, go to work,
eat, take a bath, then sleep.</i>

276
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,691
What a boring summer vacation.

277
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,777
<i>The only promise he made with Kaguya</i>

278
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,112
<i>is to go to the festival
at the end of summer holidays.</i>

279
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,030
<i>Besides that,</i>

280
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,241
<i>they haven't even sent a text
to each other.</i>

281
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:57,206
<i>Asking each other to go on a date
is an impossible obstacle for them.</i>

282
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,542
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

283
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,925
I wonder what Shinomiya is doing?

284
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,720
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

285
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,056
Why did this happen?

286
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,016
Ms. Kaguya, that's because...

287
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:22,648
{\an8}Your plans are based on the premise
that the Chairman will ask you out.

288
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,565
SUMMER HOLIDAY SCHEDULE
KAGUYA

289
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,650
You're so naive.

290
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,737
Why are you reading you're boss's notebook
without permission?

291
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,615
Why don't you just ask him out?

292
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,534
Don't be ridiculous!

293
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,787
That would give the impression
that I want to go on a date with him!

294
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,623
But that's exactly what you want to do.

295
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,918
Shinomiya...

296
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,005
What are you up to?

297
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,923
DELETE THIS E-MAIL

298
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,885
Am I a girl?

299
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,638
I write an e-mail and then I delete it
again and again!

300
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,724
Is this what first love is like?

301
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,475
<i>Yes, this is first love.</i>

302
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,477
That's it, I quit!

303
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,938
LOOK A LIVE OCTOPUS

304
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,442
CHAIRMAN
IT'S GOING TO GET COLD SO STAY WARM

305
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,572
You're not going to get more e-mails
by reading them over and over.

306
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,700
You even saved that e-mail.

307
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,746
You must have been so happy to get
your first e-mail from the Chairman.

308
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,291
I bet you like it
that he made the first move.

309
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,709
You can't forget him?

310
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,544
Stop it!

311
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,297
That's not what I'm thinking.

312
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,091
Stop analyzing my feelings.

313
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,178
I'm going out.

314
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,434
Hey, brother. Where are you going?

315
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,311
Grocery shopping for dinner.

316
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,104
Wearing your uniform?

317
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,814
I'm going to stop by at school.

318
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,027
But the school is so far away.

319
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,580
<i>What I'm doing is totally pointless.</i>

320
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,961
<i>But I can't just sit around
thinking "What if?"</i>

321
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,075
Nice and cool.

322
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:46,917
I want to see him.

323
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,686
There's no way she's here.

324
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,450
<i>-I wish the summer holiday
-I wish the summer holiday</i>

325
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,202
<i>-would be over soon.
-would be over soon.</i>

326
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,415
NO DECISION FOR TODAY'S MATCH

327
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,501
BECAUSE THEY NEVER SAW EACH OTHER

328
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,096
<i>I have no memories of summer.</i>

329
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,057
Hey, look at me!

330
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,519
<i>But that's not a problem.</i>

331
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,897
<i>I've never been on a family vacation.</i>

332
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,565
<i>It's okay though.</i>

333
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,027
<i>They all treat me like I'm special.</i>

334
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,781
<i>I've never been to a fireworks festival.</i>

335
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,783
<i>It's okay though.</i>

336
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,955
<i>The small fireworks I saw
from my window were pretty enough.</i>

337
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,086
<i>I've never gone shopping with friends.</i>

338
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,130
How about this?

339
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,382
<i>So I feel anxious and excited
at the same time.</i>

340
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,552
<i>It's going to be okay though.</i>

341
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:48,348
<i>The people that are going with me
are all nice people.</i>

342
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,936
<i>Everything is going to be fine.</i>

343
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,439
<i>I'm used to it.</i>

344
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,943
<i>I never have control over my life.</i>

345
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:05,782
{\an8}"My father suddenly asked me
to come back to our main home in Kyoto.

346
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,620
Don't worry about me and have fun."

347
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,206
That's what she said. What should we do?

348
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,584
We're going to...

349
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,502
Postpone!

350
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,630
The whole point is for all of us
to go together.

351
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,175
Good idea. You're right!

352
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,969
I'll call Kei and let her know.

353
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:30,015
<i>I know, I'm lucky.</i>

354
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,353
<i>I have friends and I was born
into a distinguished family.</i>

355
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,690
<i>I'm blessed with talents
that most people would be envious of.</i>

356
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,651
<i>It's said that the overall balance
of happiness and unhappiness</i>

357
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,737
<i>is the same for everyone.</i>

358
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,698
<i>If that's the case, then it makes sense</i>

359
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,159
<i>that someone, as blessed as me,
have to endure some hardships, too.</i>

360
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,331
Father!

361
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,875
Oh, you're here?

362
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,126
Good.

363
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,177
You came all the way home
and that's all he says?

364
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,930
Drop dead, old man.

365
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,601
<i>My father has never said
"good night" to me.</i>

366
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,270
<i>He's never said "see you later"
or "good job" to me.</i>

367
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,357
<i>I don't remember him
saying "I love you" either.</i>

368
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,610
<i>But it doesn't hurt my feelings.</i>

369
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,863
<i>My life has always been like this.</i>

370
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,616
<i>I don't feel any emotions.</i>

371
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,284
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

372
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,541
<i>People expect me to act like I come
from a dignified family.</i>

373
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,045
<i>They treat me like I'm fragile
and don't want to cause any problems.</i>

374
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,299
<i>They treat me
like a creepy traditional Japanese doll.</i>

375
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,848
<i>But I'll be okay.</i>

376
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,476
{\an8}<i>Tomorrow, I'm going
to the fireworks festival.</i>
