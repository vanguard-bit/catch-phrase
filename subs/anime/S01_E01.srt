1
00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:02,043
CONFESSION

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,964
-<i>When you fall in love with someone...</i>
-Will you...

3
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:07,674
go out with me?

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,509
<i>You confess your love...</i>

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,930
<i>and it'll be accepted.</i>

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,227
<i>Anyone would tell you
that it's a wonderful thing,</i>

7
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,397
<i>but everything about that is wrong!</i>

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:26,776
<i>Even between lovers,
there is always a clear power struggle.</i>

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>There is the one who exploits
and the one who is being exploited.</i>

10
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,573
<i>One who crushes and one who gets crushed.</i>

11
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,825
<i>There's always a winner and a loser.</i>

12
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,747
<i>You're saying
you want to live an honorable life,</i>

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,790
<i>then you should,
by no means, not become the loser.</i>

14
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>Love is a war!</i>

15
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>The moment you fall in love, you lose.</i>

16
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,691
<i>The private Shuchiin Academy.</i>

17
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,026
<i>This prestigious school,
with its ancient and noble origin,</i>

18
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>was founded to educate the pupils
born in the upper crust of the society.</i>

19
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,991
<i>Even though the nobility class system
has been abolished,</i>

20
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,576
<i>students from distinguished families,</i>

21
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,744
<i>-who will, one day, rule the country...</i>
-How do you do?

22
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,038
<i>-...continues to attend this academy.</i>
-How do you do?

23
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,209
<i>Of course, they wouldn't let
just ordinary people to lead</i>

24
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,879
-<i>and bring these students together.</i>
-Everyone!

25
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,255
Look.

26
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,550
The members of the Student Council!

27
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,929
<i>Kaguya Shinomiya,
the vice president of the Student Council.</i>

28
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,514
<i>Total assets, two hundred trillion yen.</i>

29
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,474
<i>Being the eldest daughter
of the Shinomiya Group,</i>

30
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,478
<i>who owns more than a 1,000 subsidiaries,
and four industrial groups,</i>

31
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,522
<i>she is definitely a genuine young woman.</i>

32
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,025
<i>Just like the superiority
of her bloodline,</i>

33
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,776
<i>she is, undoubtedly,
a talented young woman.</i>

34
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,697
<i>With such brilliant talents
in arts, music, and martial arts.</i>

35
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>She is Kaguya Shinomiya.</i>

36
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,952
<i>Meanwhile,
the man supporting Shinomiya is...</i>

37
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>Miyuki Shirogane,
the president of the Student Council.</i>

38
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,501
<i>Sincere, vigorous,
sensible, and intelligent,</i>

39
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,712
<i>he always ranks number one
in the mock examinations.</i>

40
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,672
<i>In contrast to the talented Kaguya,</i>

41
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,008
<i>he earns respect and awe
as an experienced scholar.</i>

42
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,260
<i>Due to his exemplary conduct,</i>

43
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,929
<i>even if he just transferred to the school,</i>

44
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,431
<i>he was selected to be the president
of the Student Council.</i>

45
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,477
<i>He, then, gets to wear
the pure gold braided cord</i>

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,188
<i>that has been passed down
through generations for 200 years.</i>

47
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,733
They look so good together
every time I see them!

48
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,695
It's like watching the gods
roaming around.

49
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,365
I wonder if they are dating?

50
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,116
Will you ask them about it, please?

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,159
No way!

52
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,787
It would be rude to just approach them.

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,330
I could never...

54
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,303
It seems like...

55
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,473
{\an8}people are gossiping about us.

56
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,768
{\an8}They're wondering
if we are a couple or not.

57
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,062
They're probably at that age of curiosity.

58
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,480
It's best to ignore them.

59
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,817
Is that so?

60
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,112
<i>The thought of me dating Shinomiya...</i>

61
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,156
<i>These people sure are having fun
talking trash about love affairs.</i>

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,741
<i>How stupid.</i>

63
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,369
<i>But then...</i>

64
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,458
<i>if Shinomiya really wants to date me,
then I would think about it.</i>

65
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,380
<i>She is interested in me, that's for sure.</i>

66
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,007
<i>So, is it only a matter of time?</i>

67
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,386
<i>I will quickly tear down her mask
of being a perfect little woman.</i>

68
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,389
<i>-She will come to me blushing and begging.</i>
-President, I long for you.

69
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,601
<i>These ordinary, ignorant people
are at it again.</i>

70
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,187
<i>Just who do they think I am?</i>

71
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,733
<i>I am someone from the Shinomiya family,
the heart of the country.</i>

72
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:21,487
<i>How could they think
that I'm dating such an ordinary person?</i>

73
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,616
<i>Well, it is true
that I have a duty to fulfill</i>

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,869
<i>because he is the president
of the Student Council.</i>

75
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:32,457
<i>But if he would kneel
and offer me his heart, and even his home,</i>

76
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,461
<i>I could train him to be a man
who's worthy of me.</i>

77
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,257
<i>Besides, is there a man who can resist
falling deeply in love with me?</i>

78
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,342
<i>It's only a matter of time.</i>

79
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,683
<i>While they were both
under their thoughts...</i>

80
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,104
<i>half a year has already gone by!</i>

81
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,151
<i>During that period of time,
nothing out of the ordinary happened.</i>

82
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,111
{\an8}STUDENT COUNCIL PRESIDENT

83
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,032
By the way,

84
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,992
the apple tree by the fountain

85
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,912
and the cherry fruits relief
are full of snails.

86
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:15,208
My little sister once went into a fountain
because it was hot and she got a cold.

87
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,919
Nothing good really comes out
when you start acting on your emotions.

88
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,047
<i>In this uneventful time,
their thoughts went from</i>

89
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,423
<i>"It would be nice to date"</i>

90
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,385
<i>to "how can I make the other
confess to me?"</i>

91
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,514
<i>Meanwhile, on the other side of the table,</i>

92
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:33,017
<i>someone was completely unaware
of this sophisticated strategy.</i>

93
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,393
STUDENT COUNCIL SECRETARY

94
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,311
Oh, by the way.

95
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,229
FUJIWARA CHIKA

96
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,271
Please listen.

97
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,442
I surprisingly won two tickets
to the cinema,

98
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:45,446
{\an8}but I'm forbidden from watching
these kinds of films at home.

99
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,364
LOVE REFRAIN

100
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,741
So do you two want to see it instead?

101
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,911
Now that you mention it,

102
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,871
surprisingly, I'm actually free
on the weekend.

103
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,375
-If that's so, Shinomiya...
-You know, there's this rumor going on.

104
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,544
That if you see this movie with somebody,

105
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,671
you two will become a couple.

106
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,506
How lovely!

107
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,508
Then, President,

108
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,719
did you just invite me?

109
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,348
You want to take me to the cinema

110
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,435
and watch a movie
that makes people become a couple?

111
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,353
My, my.

112
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,771
That's completely...

113
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,691
<i>That would be like confessing to her!</i>

114
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,401
<i>Shirogane, that's a sudden dilemma!</i>

115
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,111
<i>The rule of a romantic relationship is,</i>

116
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>"The one who falls in love, loses!"</i>

117
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,323
<i>And because they are both
filled with pride,</i>

118
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,368
<i>neither of them can freely express
their love for each other.</i>

119
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,120
<i>What should I do?</i>

120
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,664
<i>Honestly speaking,
I'll just have to deceive her.</i>

121
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,251
Will you sell them with me
at the ticket shop?

122
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,252
Oh, my.

123
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,505
You, out of all people,
are panicking and making a fuss out of it?

124
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,141
How cute of you.

125
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,103
<i>I won't let that happen!</i>

126
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,731
<i>I, Shirogane,
shouldn't be the one to back down!</i>

127
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,150
<i>The one who would run away
should be you, Shinomiya.</i>

128
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,444
Oh, yes. I did invite you to the cinema.

129
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,280
I don't really believe
those kinds of groundless rumors,

130
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,449
but you seem to like the idea of it.

131
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,453
Do you want to see this movie with me?

132
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,622
<i>That moment, Shinomiya thought...</i>

133
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:21,876
<i>After showing so much interest
on how you want to see the movie with me,</i>

134
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,711
<i>you're suddenly
leaving the decision up to me?</i>

135
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,505
<i>That's a nice turn of events.</i>

136
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,092
<i>Even if I have the choice
of refusing his invitation,</i>

137
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,638
<i>all of the work I've done
would become useless.</i>

138
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,555
YOU HAVE WON

139
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,265
<i>Purposely fabricating the prize Chika won,</i>

140
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,976
<i>and putting it personally on her mailbox.</i>

141
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,228
Oh, yes!

142
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,731
<i>The plan of choosing a day
I knew he would be free on...</i>

143
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,566
<i>will all be useless!</i>

144
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,278
<i>Then if I refuse his invitation now,</i>

145
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,280
<i>there might not be another chance
for him to invite me</i>

146
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,615
<i>to something like this.</i>

147
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
<i>For a young lady, it's a no!</i>

148
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,577
<i>I am not saying yes
to this kind of choice!</i>

149
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,622
I... see...

150
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:04,710
In the end, I still can't help myself
but to believe in those kinds of stories,

151
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,505
so if I were to go with you,

152
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,675
I would like you to, at least, ask me
with a little more enthusiasm.

153
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,595
<i>She's using her
"Play the innocent girl" skills!</i>

154
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,723
<i>It's a negotiation skill
that runs in the Shinomiya family.</i>

155
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,892
<i>This calculated facial expression</i>

156
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,396
<i>is said to make
even the hearts of gods beat faster.</i>

157
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,482
<i>In fact, Shirogane's thoughts
are now also dispersed.</i>

158
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,402
<i>Well, confessing
is most likely a man's job.</i>

159
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,279
<i>While Shirogane
was clouded with his thoughts,</i>

160
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,781
<i>there's no way Shinomiya will let
this chance slip through her hands.</i>

161
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,408
<i>She enacted her plan in an instant.</i>

162
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:40,121
I think I am at the age when I would like
to experience love, even just once.

163
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,751
<i>The battle of wits presents itself
like a chess problem.</i>

164
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,295
<i>Shinomiya is the one who is pursuing,</i>

165
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,672
<i>while Shirogane is looking
for a chance to reverse the game.</i>

166
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,466
<i>The intelligence of these geniuses
who can see two or three moves ahead</i>

167
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,344
<i>surpasses that of ordinary people
in its speed as they crash.</i>

168
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,221
<i>Kaguya is strengthening her defense.</i>

169
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,973
<i>Shirogane is about to crumble.</i>

170
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,351
<i>Their thoughts are heading towards
forming a logical conclusion.</i>

171
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,146
<i>The person who completes the conclusion
will be the victor...</i>

172
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,899
If you hate romantic movies,

173
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,528
I also have tickets
for <i>Saving the Tottori Bird</i>!

174
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,363
<i>Saving...</i>

175
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,531
<i>The Tottori Bird?</i>

176
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,908
<i>Chaos Theory.</i>

177
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,453
<i>Due to the sudden remarks
of Fujiwara, the secretary,</i>

178
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,705
<i>the theory got jumbled up
just before it was completed</i>

179
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,749
<i>by a little bit of chaos that entered it.</i>

180
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,751
<i>This mere sparkle of chaos</i>

181
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:31,172
<i>can result in an explosion
as big as the Big Bang.</i>

182
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,926
<i>To deal with the increasing number
of choices,</i>

183
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,887
<i>-the two geniuses have to force...</i>
-What's wrong?

184
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,597
<i>their brains to go beyond its limits.</i>

185
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,514
<i>And the result,</i>

186
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,850
<i>their brains suddenly want
large quantities of sugar!</i>

187
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,813
<i>The only existing source of sugar
in this room is the steamed bun.</i>

188
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,731
<i>So that means,</i>

189
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,900
<i>the one who gets the steamed bun</i>

190
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,068
<i>is the victor!</i>

191
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,030
The afternoon classes
are about to start, right?

192
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,576
See you after school, then!

193
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>This is the sophisticated war of love</i>

194
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,127
<i>fought by the two geniuses
who are filled with pride and ingenuity.</i>

195
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,505
TODAY'S BATTLE RESULTS

196
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,675
BOTH OF THEM LOST

197
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,761
<i>Let me repeat!</i>

198
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,972
<i>This is a sophisticated war of love</i>

199
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,850
{\an8}<i>fought by the two geniuses
who are filled with pride and ingenuity.</i>

200
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,321
A love letter?

201
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,449
Yes, the content is very passionate,

202
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,451
he is asking me
to eat at the cafeteria just once.

203
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,121
In other words, he's asking you out?

204
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,623
<i>A love letter for Shinomiya?</i>

205
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,084
<i>It seems like there are also stupid men
when it comes to love.</i>

206
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,838
<i>We are referring to the Shinomiya
who spends her time staring at me.</i>

207
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,423
<i>Does this guy know that compared to me,</i>

208
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,508
<i>everyone else just looks like
a talking weed</i>

209
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,593
{\an8}<i>-or he just haven't noticed it yet?</i>
-Hello!

210
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,679
<i>There's no way she'd go out with him.</i>

211
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,431
Do you plan to go out with him?

212
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,682
Of course.

213
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,935
<i>Have you lost your mind, Shinomiya?</i>

214
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,896
<i>How can you accept
a stranger's invitation so recklessly?</i>

215
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,523
This person can muster up the courage

216
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,276
to write such a passionate
love letter to me.

217
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,778
I'm sure I will fall in love with him.

218
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,696
<i>You idiot!</i>

219
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,573
<i>Like I would just stand by and watch.</i>

220
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,616
<i>I have to stop Shinomiya
in any way possible.</i>

221
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,162
Don't go on a date with another man!

222
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,210
Does it bother you so much
that another man got to be with me?

223
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,008
How cute of you.

224
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,178
<i>That would be the same as confessing!</i>

225
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,680
<i>I can't say something
that would sound like I like her!</i>

226
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,764
<i>That is something...</i>

227
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,477
<i>-I want to avoid happening at all costs!</i>
-Kaguya, are you really going to go?

228
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,770
Yes. I'm already looking forward to it.

229
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:56,233
<i>This behavior of Kaguya seems like that
of an unprincipled girl in love.</i>

230
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,194
<i>There is no way I would go.</i>

231
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,488
<i>What could this kid be thinking?</i>

232
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,906
<i>A bluff, of course!</i>

233
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,241
<i>If I were to be invited by someone,</i>

234
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,828
<i>someone would have to offer me a country,
and then I would decide if they're worthy.</i>

235
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,540
<i>Who would like to do charity work?</i>

236
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,125
<i>How rude of me</i>

237
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,294
<i>-to expect her to date a weed!</i>
-Weed, weed!

238
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,715
<i>After all, this is a strategy
to make Shirogane stop her.</i>

239
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,385
<i>A battle of love and wits!</i>

240
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,346
<i>Between two haughty people,</i>

241
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,640
<i>where none of them
can confess their love on their own.</i>

242
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,059
<i>So there is no choice
but to use their talents and ingenuity</i>

243
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,478
<i>and make the opposing side confess.</i>

244
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,856
<i>Is there a way to stop her
as casual as possible? Think!</i>

245
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,191
<i>His intelligence is tested!</i>

246
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,192
<i>It's no use.</i>

247
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:43,322
<i>As long as he doesn't bow his head
and ask me obediently, I won't back down.</i>

248
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,740
<i>What a clever tactic.</i>

249
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,450
<i>This is indeed the battle
of love and wits!</i>

250
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,037
<i>The duel unfolds between the two.</i>

251
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,831
Shinomiya,

252
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,875
as the President of the Student Council,

253
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,086
I can't recommend
an illicit sexual affair.

254
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,420
<i>He found another approach.</i>

255
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,258
<i>Speaking not as a normal individual,
but as the Student Council President.</i>

256
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,093
<i>That's a very clever perspective.</i>

257
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,511
Don't exaggerate.

258
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,763
I'm just going to the cafeteria.

259
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,765
The teachers would judge you.

260
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,518
It's entirely possible
to be suspended from school over this.

261
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,355
If you really want to go, so be it.

262
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,025
{\an8}I will tell the teachers on your behalf.

263
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,903
<i>A snitch to teachers!</i>

264
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,364
<i>While it can be very effective,</i>

265
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:29,410
<i>it's a risky choice that labels the person
who used it as a coward forever,</i>

266
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:34,123
<i>but for Shirogane, stopping Shinomiya
is more important than his honor.</i>

267
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,458
<i>This resoluteness also worked on Kaguya.</i>

268
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,211
<i>I didn't think he would really use
such a forbidden move,</i>

269
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,213
<i>but I must go forward with it.</i>

270
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,423
I don't mind.

271
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:47,553
If it were true love, I would even
accept expulsion from the school.

272
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,680
Expulsion?

273
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:54,476
For true love, I am prepared
to offer my whole body and soul.

274
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,979
<i>Her whole body and soul?</i>

275
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,315
-<i>Big damage to Shirogane!</i>
-Stupid!

276
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,941
What a stupid thing to say!

277
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,484
It's not stupid!

278
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,112
He has declared
his passionate love for me.

279
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,323
I would be ungrateful
if I didn't answer it

280
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,824
by being prepared to risk expulsion!

281
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,242
This is not something to joke about!

282
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,244
And what if I was the one
who confessed to you?

283
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,875
Hypothetically speaking.

284
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,835
Hypothetically.

285
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,630
Could you forget about that man?

286
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,509
There...

287
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,221
There is a possibility.

288
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,146
Is that what you call true love, then?

289
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,568
If you could forget about him
just because another man confessed to you,

290
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,403
then it can't be true love.

291
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,864
I only said that there was a possibility.

292
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,951
I see, I see. What a tremendous love.

293
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,452
If he were really worried about me,

294
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,704
he should stop me
without caring about how he looks like!

295
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,789
I don't know anymore,

296
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,499
but I am really going.

297
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,669
If he doesn't confess passionately
enough to make me cry,

298
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,170
I will really go!

299
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,838
President...

300
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,847
I don't want you
to belong to someone else, Kaguya!

301
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,808
-I don't want you to be expelled!
-Fujiwara...

302
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,561
No, no, I don't want to lose you!

303
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:21,981
<i>Jeez!</i>

304
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,693
<i>I won't go, so let go of me!</i>

305
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:31,198
<i>Today's result, Kaguya lost.</i>

306
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,825
A PASSIONATE LOVE LETTER HAS ARRIVED

307
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,328
BY HAYASAKA

308
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,289
You can't!

309
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,127
Why? It's okay, just let me have one bite!

310
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,755
All right, but...

311
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,258
There you go! Open up!

312
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,306
That's improper!

313
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,559
{\an8}Are you really that furious about it?

314
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:02,187
{\an8}They're not aware of their status
as students of the traditional Shuchiin.

315
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,232
To coax things out of each other
in public like that.

316
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,442
It's despicable!

317
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,235
<i>It's vulgar and ridiculous.</i>

318
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,947
That's an awful way of describing it.

319
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,909
President, do you have
a home-made lunch today?

320
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,497
My grandpa from the countryside
sent me a lot of vegetables.

321
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,876
-I know it's tasty despite how it looks.
-Miyuki, eat properly!

322
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,925
<i>For Kaguya, that lunch was the first
magnificent sight in her life.</i>

323
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,095
<i>Kaguya's lunch was prepared
by a team of chefs</i>

324
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,431
<i>and delivered to her.</i>

325
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,391
<i>It was a lunch menu</i>

326
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,561
<i>based on a perfect nutritional balance
and an assortment of seasonal ingredients.</i>

327
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,898
<i>That was the lunch box Kaguya knew.</i>

328
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,984
<i>Fried food, red wiener sausage,
rolled omelet,</i>

329
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,445
<i>hamburgers, pickled plumbs, and...</i>

330
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,447
<i>rice seasoning.</i>

331
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,699
<i>All the things she wanted to eat</i>

332
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,702
<i>stuffed together inside a lunchbox
just like in a child's treasure,</i>

333
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,205
<i>her heart longed fiercely
for such freedom.</i>

334
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,833
<i>Octopus-shaped sausages.
They really exist!</i>

335
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,462
<i>I want to try them, but...</i>

336
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,381
-<i>Kaguya's pride wouldn't allow for it.</i>
-Lunch, lunch!

337
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,676
Are you having a lunch box today?
It looks delicious!

338
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,179
Is that so? I made everything myself.

339
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,682
Oh, can I have a bite?

340
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,851
I don't really mind.

341
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,312
<i>Really?</i>

342
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,231
Yes, so do you want this hamburger?

343
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,441
-All right!
<i>-Fujiwara?</i>

344
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,070
I WANT IT

345
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,448
<i>This is delicious!</i>

346
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:43,038
Hamburgers are tasty when it's still hot
with all the juices flowing inside it,

347
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,958
but they're even better
at normal temperature!

348
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,628
I ate everything already
while all the flavors are still inside!

349
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,755
<i>Okay, then eat this one, too!</i>

350
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,673
Yes!

351
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,426
<i>Fujiwara.</i>

352
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,471
<i>I thought you were my friend,</i>

353
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,017
<i>but if you were to die tomorrow,
I wouldn't help you.</i>

354
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,939
<i>What's with that disdainful look
on Shinomiya's face?</i>

355
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,275
<i>Is she really...</i>

356
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,236
<i>Is she really despising my lunch box
that much?</i>

357
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,654
<i>How dare she laugh at me!</i>

358
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,573
<i>I'll teach her a lesson!</i>

359
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,326
<i>That's hot miso soup!</i>

360
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,288
<i>The rice grows cold and hard,</i>

361
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,957
<i>but if you eat it with the miso soup,</i>

362
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,460
<i>in that moment,
it suddenly becomes the best thing.</i>

363
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,795
Try it out.

364
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,880
Okay.

365
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,842
<i>Wait, why is she eating
from parts where Shirogane has eaten?</i>

366
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,051
<i>That's like an indirect kiss!</i>

367
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,345
<i>From the cup, too?</i>

368
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:49,021
The rice...
the rice is melting in my mouth!

369
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:53,275
That's right. From old times,
cold rice had an established reputation.

370
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,904
Its compatibility with warm soup
has always been excellent!

371
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,489
It's really delicious!
President, you're a genius.

372
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,742
Oh, stop it!

373
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,452
<i>What do you think now, Shinomiya?</i>

374
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,496
-<i>Did you know that cold rice is delicious?</i>
-It's so good.

375
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,748
You can make it your business!

376
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,708
-It's really a must-have experience!
-<i>Kaguya!</i>

377
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,461
<i>Kaguya!</i>

378
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,755
<i>Kaguya, let's go home together!</i>

379
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,716
<i>I'm so happy to have a sleepover with you!</i>

380
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,637
<i>It doesn't hurt, but I still want to cry!</i>

381
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,559
<i>Goodbye, Fujiwara.
This is the end of our friendship.</i>

382
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,355
<i>She's looking even more disdainful now!</i>

383
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,648
<i>Just why is that?</i>

384
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:37,819
<i>Is that so? If she can act like that,
I have a few thoughts of my own.</i>

385
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,365
<i>Just you wait until tomorrow!</i>

386
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,075
THE NEXT DAY

387
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,789
You put so much energy
into your lunch box today.

388
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,126
My chefs kind of got excited today.

389
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,921
It looks as delicious as usual.

390
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,381
<i>That's right.</i>

391
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,301
<i>Then ask me, "Can I have a bite, please?"</i>

392
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,596
<i>If you do that, I will be so generous...</i>

393
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,682
Give me, give me!

394
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,394
Well, then, let's exchange lunch boxes.

395
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,354
<i>That's how I would give it to you.</i>

396
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,606
<i>Come now, ask me anytime.</i>

397
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,734
Should we eat, too?

398
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,986
Yes, sure.

399
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,824
Wow, you have octopus-shaped
sausages today, too.

400
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,784
That's right, that's a staple food for me.

401
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,119
That's nice.

402
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,830
They're cute and tasty, they're the best!

403
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,957
Isn't that exaggerating it a bit?

404
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,126
No, they're good!

405
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,711
They're even tasty in my tummy!

406
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,714
I see, I see...

407
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,007
President.

408
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,884
Oysters are your favorite food, right?

409
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,097
<i>Why does she have this disturbing aura
around her since yesterday?</i>

410
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,517
<i>Why is she offering me exquisite food
like this for no reason at all?</i>

411
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,105
-<i>She, surely, is up to something!</i>
-Well, well.

412
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,066
What a cute lunch box you have there.

413
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,695
<i>I am bestowing some charity upon you,
you pitiable president.</i>

414
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,697
<i>Is she pitying me?</i>

415
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,657
<i>How humiliating.</i>

416
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,534
<i>I won't have it.</i>

417
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,119
<i>I will definitely not have it.</i>

418
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,580
If she gives me something that exquisite,

419
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,123
I can't give her anything in return.

420
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,459
-The sausages are so good!
-Kaguya?

421
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,585
Doesn't it hurt?

422
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,295
Is your head okay?

423
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,131
<i>I have no choice but to hear her insults.</i>

424
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,593
Never mind that, what's that thing?

425
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,219
Ah, this?

426
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,389
The president made this for me.

427
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,850
Making two lunch boxes
is really the same work as making one.

428
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,103
It's so tasty!

429
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,522
Is it? I'm glad.

430
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,275
Appearance is also important, right?

431
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,569
-That's true.
-<i>Domestic animal disguised as human.</i>

432
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,697
-<i>A wretched parasite who relies on humans.</i>
-It's delicious!

433
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,241
<i>All that nutrition going to your heart
and not to your brain.</i>

434
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,202
-<i>What a disgusting animal.</i>
-Thank you!

435
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,288
-<i>I will never forgive you!</i>
-Yummy.

436
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,624
<i>Shinomiya is giving me a deathly stare.</i>

437
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,541
Damn it!

438
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,835
Aren't the clubs meeting today?

439
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,128
I have to hurry up and eat.

440
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,799
<i>No, the octopus-shaped sausage!</i>

441
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,258
Well, then, I'm off!

442
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,766
<i>What am I doing?</i>

443
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,976
<i>I'm an idiot.</i>

444
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,189
Kaguya.

445
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,532
It's delicious, right?

446
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,492
Let's eat together.

447
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,709
Fujiwara, forgive me.

448
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,712
I was wrong about you.

449
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,132
You are truly a human being.

450
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,300
What did you think I was before that?

451
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,635
Have confidence.

452
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:52,389
<i>-Today's result...</i>
-I never doubted myself about being human!

453
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,392
<i>Kaguya won due to Shirogane's retreat.</i>

454
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,357
Good grief.

455
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,985
{\an8}The president is giving me trouble.

456
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,698
{\an8}He still won't come and confess to me,
even after I prepared everything.

457
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,783
Miss Kaguya.

458
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,535
{\an8}Speaking hypothetically,

459
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,079
{\an8}if you were to truly
fall in love with him,

460
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,707
{\an8}would you wait for him to confess
like how you are doing it now?

461
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,667
{\an8}Or would you go to him?

462
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,627
{\an8}<i>The battle of love and wits</i>

463
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:26,673
{\an8}<i>is a fight of the spirit,
in which their dignity is at stake.</i>

464
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,300
{\an8}If a time like that came,

465
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,635
{\an8}I would consider the risk
of him being taken away by someone

466
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,929
{\an8}and evaluate rationally.

467
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,390
I would surely go and tell him.

468
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,058
Surely?

469
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,810
<i>Absolutely.</i>

470
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,145
Yes, surely.

471
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:41,980
Surely...

472
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:45,025
{\an8}<i>It's certainly not because she is ashamed
or she just can't confess her love,</i>

473
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,568
<i>or because she is afraid of rejection</i>

474
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,196
<i>or for some stupid reason like that.</i>

475
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,198
<i>This, I would like you to understand.</i>

476
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,450
CONFESSION

477
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,620
Whatever, it doesn't matter!

478
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,537
