1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,335
Meow!

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,796
Is that all right?

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,632
It's so cute!

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,928
The cat ears are on Fujiwara's time,
Shinomiya is on mine.

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,513
That's right!

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,892
In other words,

7
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,312
the time you brought was originally
just for Shinomiya and the cat ears.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,816
I'm scared!

9
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,985
<i>Cat ears and a little girl.</i>

10
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,903
<i>It's a symbiosis.</i>

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>These things were born into the world
in order to be joined together.</i>

12
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,452
<i>Like the clover and the honeybee.</i>

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>A crocodile and a hummingbird.</i>

14
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,621
<i>Avocado and soy sauce.</i>

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,915
<i>And then, the cat.</i>

16
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,752
<i>Majority of humans like cats.</i>

17
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>And then we have here,</i>

18
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,882
<i>a girl with an attractive face and figure,
Kaguya Shinomiya.</i>

19
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:52,719
<i>How did he realize the compatibility
between the two living beings?</i>

20
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>-She's cute!
-Marriage!</i>

21
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,401
Is cosplay really necessary
for the welcome party?

22
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,652
Yes!

23
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,947
After Japan, France is the country
where cosplay is popular.

24
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,032
When doing cosplay,
you don't need any words.

25
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,702
This is the best strategy
to break language barriers

26
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,579
and deepen our friendships.

27
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,663
But...

28
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,665
What do you think, President?

29
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,586
-<i>She's cute!
-Marriage!</i>

30
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,755
That's right.

31
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,634
-It's all right.
<i>-She is so cute.</i>

32
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,594
<i>This is not good.</i>

33
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,597
<i>When I look at Shinomiya,
my face gets too enthusiastic.</i>

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,932
<i>I need to calm down
and look at her normally.</i>

35
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,769
Your face is scary!

36
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,106
<i>His reaction is weak.</i>

37
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,110
<i>In the end, these clothes
don't look good on me.</i>

38
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,529
<i>-People with charm like Fujiwara</i>
-What's wrong?

39
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,156
<i>-should wear this.</i>
-What?

40
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,910
You should also endure it, President.

41
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,370
<i>Meow!</i>

42
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,165
How do I put it?

43
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,917
Well, it's not so good.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,251
<i>She's not being frank.</i>

45
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,502
<i>Did she completely understand?</i>

46
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,213
This can't look good on me.

47
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,342
It's good!

48
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,180
<i>So cute!</i>

49
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,932
<i>Marriage!</i>

50
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,183
<i>What?</i>

51
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,227
<i>He just put cat ears on!</i>

52
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,356
<i>No matter what others think,
it looks perfect in Kaguya's mind.</i>

53
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,774
<i>What should I do?</i>

54
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,776
<i>I can't stop smiling.</i>

55
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,322
<i>If I don't stop, they will see
that I think he looks cute</i>

56
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,907
What's wrong, Shinomiya?

57
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,659
<i>Now that it has come to this...</i>

58
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,828
Nothing at all.

59
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,331
<i>The trick of biting your lip.</i>

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,544
<i>But that is also not perfect.</i>

61
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,673
<i>She is still left with half a smile.</i>

62
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,591
What's with that face, Shinomiya?

63
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,219
Do you have a problem with my cat ears?

64
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,680
No, no way.

65
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,265
It looks...

66
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,558
very good on you.

67
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,269
<i>That facial expression.</i>

68
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,479
<i>It's like looking at an insect.</i>

69
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,565
<i>It's as if it looks so bad on me,
that I don't qualify as a human.</i>

70
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,735
Fujiwara, let's take a picture
of the President.

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,821
That's a good idea!

72
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:45,451
Let's save this image
for future generations.

73
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,370
<i>That is a blackmail expression.</i>

74
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,581
<i>She wants to use this as a threat
or a bargaining chip someday.</i>

75
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,041
I absolutely won't allow it!

76
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,501
Don't say that.

77
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,296
-Now you, Kaguya!
-Me, too?

78
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,714
Shinomiya, too?

79
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,508
<i>If she takes a picture,
they will see my weakness.</i>

80
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,801
<i>But...</i>

81
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,222
<i>at the same time, I will legally get
a picture of this cute living being.</i>

82
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,598
<i>The two choices hang in balance.</i>

83
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,518
<i>Pros and cons weigh just as much.</i>

84
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,354
TWO ALTERNATIVES

85
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,900
Take proper pictures, Fujiwara!

86
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,653
<i>Shirogane chose to preserve the cuteness.</i>

87
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,239
<i>That's a choice he would
normally never make.</i>

88
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,699
Well...

89
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,993
take it with 4,000 pixels, please.

90
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,244
Okay!

91
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,331
<i>She's even cuter up close. Damn it!</i>

92
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,499
<i>My face muscles grow stiff!</i>

93
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,127
<i>It looks so good on him!</i>

94
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,296
<i>No, my mouth is smiling again.</i>

95
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,465
You two...

96
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,550
smile more cheerfully, please.

97
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,843
-Not possible.
-I can't.

98
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,388
<i>I want to see
how cute he is from up close.</i>

99
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,266
<i>I want to go closer and burn this image
into my memory.</i>

100
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,393
Why are you looking
into each other's eyes?

101
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,103
You two!

102
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,439
If you are going to fight,
I am confiscating these!

103
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,989
<i>Just now, what were we doing?</i>

104
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,784
<i>What was that compulsive feeling?</i>

105
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,744
<i>That was scary.</i>

106
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,455
<i>-Cat ears are scary!
-Cat ears are scary!</i>

107
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,707
<i>Today's result,</i>

108
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,668
<i>Secretary Fujiwara lost.</i>

109
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,754
NO WEARING OF CAT EARS
FOR STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBERS

110
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,757
Meow!

111
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,595
The welcome party is on Monday next week.

112
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,430
{\an8}Apart from setting up,

113
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,642
{\an8}we need to buy souvenirs
and Japanese sweets.

114
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,894
Two people have to go shopping, right?

115
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,813
{\an8}We'll also need general goods,

116
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,774
and there will be many participants,
so the quantity needed is great.

117
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,527
So we need to give up
our free day for shopping?

118
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,487
What a bothersome task.

119
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,572
Oh, what a hassle.

120
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,783
Who would want to do it?

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,576
Right, Shinomiya?

122
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,912
That's right.

123
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,958
If nobody wants to go,
it will be a problem.

124
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,044
Well, if it's really necessary,
I don't mind that much.

125
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,799
So should we play a game
and the loser has to go shopping?

126
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:05,925
-A game?
-A game?

127
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,260
Yes!

128
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,970
The bad words game.

129
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,389
<i>The bad words game.</i>

130
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,141
Yes.

131
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,600
This is an example.

132
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,146
You write the word on a note like this
and give it to the person on the right.

133
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,815
Please hold it up
so that you can't read it.

134
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,277
If the person says that word, they lose.

135
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:25,987
I see.

136
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,531
So you don't know what
the forbidden word is.

137
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,116
It's simple.

138
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,492
You just lost.

139
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,537
All right, let's play.

140
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,626
You give it to the person on the right.

141
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,753
Then I should write...

142
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,090
<i>a word that Fujiwara would use.</i>

143
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,425
<i>But...</i>

144
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,261
<i>the two people who will lose
will go shopping.</i>

145
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,055
<i>Well, a man is needed for carrying things</i>

146
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,434
<i>and nobody can beat Shinomiya in knowledge
about Japanese traditional sweets.</i>

147
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,478
<i>In the end, it's all about efficiency.</i>

148
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,189
<i>In that case, I have to let Fujiwara win</i>

149
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,149
<i>and defeat Shinomiya.</i>

150
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,317
FIRST PLACE
FUJIWARA

151
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,488
{\an8}<i>There is no way Fujiwara
would say this word.</i>

152
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,865
<i>I won this game!</i>

153
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,409
Are we ready to play?

154
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,085
<i>Yo, we're starting right now, yo!</i>

155
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,171
Secretary Fujiwara?

156
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,550
<i>The game words are derived from
words I usually use</i>

157
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,385
<i>I can't take it, yo!</i>

158
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,721
<i>That's why I changed
my speaking style, yo!</i>

159
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,098
<i>Too bad, man!</i>

160
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,892
<i>No!</i>

161
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,062
<i>Don't look!</i>

162
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,855
<i>-Yo! Yo!
-This is bad.</i>

163
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,565
<i>She doesn't usually say "check it out."</i>

164
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,319
<i>Kaguya, what do you think
is your word, yo?</i>

165
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,404
<i>Say "ho!"</i>

166
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,241
<i>Say "ho!"</i>

167
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,494
<i>Say "ho"?</i>

168
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,915
<i>Yikes, she's acting so adult!</i>

169
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,167
<i>In this game,
there is a surefire way to win.</i>

170
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,711
<i>That is to not speak at all.</i>

171
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,005
Say "yes."

172
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,715
-Shinomiya.
-Yes?

173
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,134
The game won't progress
if you're like that.

174
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,596
At least talk the minimum
necessary to maintain a conversation.

175
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,390
I have no choice, right?

176
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,683
I understand.

177
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,768
<i>"Inevitable behavior."</i>

178
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,688
<i>Each person will act in a certain way.</i>

179
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,316
<i>If you create a certain situation,
it will generate a corresponding behavior.</i>

180
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,776
<i>That's the gist of the game.</i>

181
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:29,986
<i>However,</i>

182
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,321
<i>how will I make her say that word?</i>

183
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,157
<i>I've been trying to make her say
that for half a year.</i>

184
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,617
<i>I lack the ability for it.</i>

185
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,452
<i>Well,</i>

186
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,664
<i>I should just get her talking
about things she likes.</i>

187
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,751
Secretary Fujiwara,
is there something you don't like?

188
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,837
<i>Shirogane passed the topic
of dislike to Fujiwara,</i>

189
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,548
<i>a word easy to connect with "like."</i>

190
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,968
Something that I dislike?

191
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,013
There are things, yes.

192
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,933
People often tell me
I can't read a situation.

193
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,772
Some people also say
that it has its advantages.

194
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:11,402
But they don't include me
when they talk about romantic feelings.

195
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,196
They say I always step on landmines!

196
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,449
<i>That is a sound assessment.</i>

197
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,036
When I think I might cause trouble
for people without knowing it,

198
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,954
I get very sad.

199
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,417
So that is something I dislike.

200
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,461
Fujiwara.

201
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,344
Nobody thinks you cause trouble.

202
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:41,974
There are many people
who rely on your frankness.

203
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,434
Kaguya.

204
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,478
Really?

205
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,481
You don't hate me, Kaguya?

206
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,151
What? No, of course, I...

207
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,070
like you.

208
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,155
<i>I win, yo!</i>

209
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,909
LIKE

210
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,828
<i>Inevitable behavior.</i>

211
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,373
<i>In the end, it was inevitable
for kind Kaguya</i>

212
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,292
<i>to try and comfort a troubled Fujiwara.</i>

213
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,294
<i>Fujiwara interpreted this correctly.</i>

214
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,462
<i>Amazing!</i>

215
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,005
<i>That was wicked.</i>

216
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,633
Was all you just said a lie?

217
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,219
<i>Not a lie, but a bluff, yo!</i>

218
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,348
<i>There's no way people wouldn't tell me
about their romantic feelings, yo!</i>

219
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,975
<i>The rest is easy with this result.</i>

220
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,561
<i>If I let my guard down
and follow her lead,</i>

221
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,854
<i>I will automatically lose.</i>

222
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,273
<i>Everything she needs
for winning is achieved</i>

223
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,191
<i>However...</i>

224
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,318
<i>-Was that really a bluff?
-Rain falling!</i>

225
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,195
<i>-In every bluff...
-Spears are falling!</i>

226
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,948
<i>-you can hide a morsel of truth.</i>
-It's nice to be so carefree!

227
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,951
<i>If that is so, how much of it is a lie?</i>

228
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,205
<i>Are Fujiwara's words
about feeling alienated</i>

229
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,207
<i>and her eyes just lying?</i>

230
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,210
<i>If there is even a slightest possibility,</i>

231
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,798
<i>it is wrong to lose on purpose.</i>

232
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:00,302
<i>I don't believe in hurting others
for the sake of your own good.</i>

233
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,888
<i>This is part of my moral code.</i>

234
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,642
<i>Prioritizing my own circumstances
and losing on purpose...</i>

235
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,437
<i>That would also be pursuing my gain
and alienating her.</i>

236
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,314
<i>Going shopping with Shinomiya
might be wonderful,</i>

237
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,691
<i>but I...</i>

238
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,694
<i>I can't betray my personal conviction.</i>

239
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,447
Secretary Fujiwara.

240
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,576
From now on, I will be playing seriously.

241
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,494
<i>Boom, yo!</i>

242
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,749
I did it! I even beat the president! Yes!

243
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,002
<i>Inevitable behavior.</i>

244
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,087
<i>An individual will react</i>

245
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,048
<i>to a certain situation
in a characteristic way.</i>

246
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,468
<i>And being able to predict that</i>

247
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,178
<i>is the gist of the game.</i>

248
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,472
So we're going shopping, right?

249
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,184
Well, we lost, so there's no helping it.

250
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,977
<i>The bad words game</i>

251
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,814
<i>is a game to find out
how much you understand one another.</i>

252
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,027
Oh, damn it! I was beaten.

253
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,070
We'll go buy some souvenirs.

254
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,947
-I am looking forward to it.
<i>-Today's result,</i>

255
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,116
<i>Shirogane totally lost.</i>

256
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,036
"Check it out"?

257
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,874
The President said we will talk
about shopping after school.

258
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,875
I see.

259
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,169
The day he bought a smartphone,

260
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,713
we exchanged mail addresses
and telephone numbers.

261
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,759
But I've been waiting for so long,
and he hasn't contacted me at all!

262
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,803
It seems like he doesn't want
to be the first to write to me!

263
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,805
"President, I'm looking forward..."

264
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,307
What are you doing?

265
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,685
Well, I thought
you should contact him instead.

266
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,187
No way!

267
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,189
{\an8}I can't send it first!

268
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,857
{\an8}That's a bit dull.

269
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,901
Miss Kaguya.

270
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,820
Do you like President Shirogane?

271
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,909
Well, I think of him without disdain.

272
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,868
I see.

273
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,869
But...

274
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,581
I just think that
he has some qualities that I lack

275
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,667
that's why I'm interested in him.

276
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,753
It's not a romantic feeling at all.

277
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,382
So, if the little secretary
and Shirogane were to date?

278
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,803
What is it?

279
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,346
You're wrong!

280
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,558
I just don't want to lose Fujiwara
to the President.

281
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,394
She's my precious friend.

282
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,313
LOOK, A LIVE OCTOPUS!

283
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,693
A precious friend, right?

284
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,737
If you really care so much about it,
Miss Kaguya,

285
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,448
don't write to him, call him.

286
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,117
Call him?

287
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,578
He thinks he will receive a message.

288
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,205
Take advantage of his negligence
and attack first.

289
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,331
Negligence?

290
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,791
Attack first?

291
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,793
It's a perfect plan.

292
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,087
Before Miss Kaguya starts arguing
for argument's sake,

293
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,505
I press click and...

294
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,882
Here you go!

295
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,135
Wait a second! I'm not braced for it!

296
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,053
CALLING

297
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:48,971
<i>Yes?</i>

298
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,390
This is Shinomiya.

299
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,601
Is that you, President?

300
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,936
I am Miyuki's father.

301
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,482
<i>Well...</i>

302
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,985
<i>By the way, is Mr. Shirogane home?</i>

303
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,571
I am also called Shirogane.

304
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,822
Not you.

305
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,908
I mean, is Mr. Miyuki home?

306
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,659
<i>Oh, my son?</i>

307
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,869
<i>Miyuki!</i>

308
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,662
<i>There's a girl on the phone!</i>

309
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,165
<i>What? A girl is calling my brother?</i>

310
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,124
<i>Hey!</i>

311
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,418
<i>Don't just answer people's phones
whenever you like, Dad!</i>

312
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,380
It's me.

313
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,299
Oh, it's Shinomiya.

314
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,884
<i>Oh, Shinomiya?</i>

315
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,512
I just called regarding
the matter of tomorrow.

316
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,306
Is now a good time?

317
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,184
I am in the bathtub, but it's okay.

318
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,310
In the bathtub?

319
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,021
That means he's naked.

320
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,315
Miss Kaguya, you are now talking to

321
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,192
-a completely naked man.
<i>-Is the sound muffled?</i>

322
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,152
I will call you again later.

323
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,612
<i>No, it's all right.</i>

324
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,156
My smartphone is waterproof.

325
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,824
No, it's not all right.

326
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,453
Can we meet in front of Hachiko
at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow?

327
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,621
Yes.

328
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,665
We will buy the sweets and go to Hands.

329
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,333
That's about it, right?

330
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,876
Yes.

331
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,794
EXTEND THE CONVERSATION

332
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,920
<i>See you tomorrow, then.</i>

333
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,254
Okay.

334
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,339
<i>Oh, Shinomiya...</i>

335
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,217
What?

336
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,635
What was he going to say?

337
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,349
I'm going to sleep already.

338
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,646
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS THAT

339
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,857
IT MIGHT BE COLD TONIGHT,
SO KEEP WARM AND SLEEP WELL

340
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,777
I'm glad you had your first message.

341
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,990
<i>Today's result, Kaguya won.</i>

342
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,287
THE NEXT DAY

343
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,040
It seems Shibuya Station was flooded.

344
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,917
I'm going.

345
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,920
The President is waiting for me.

346
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,589
I have to go!

347
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,091
There is no way he is coming.

348
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,513
"A cancellation message."

349
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,600
Oh well, at least,
it's the first message from Shinomiya.

350
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,228
Then, shall I call it a day?

351
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,441
I'm glad my smartphone is waterproof.

352
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,527
THE END OF THE NERVE-WRACKING
SHOPPING TRIP

353
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,321
IT TOOK 30 MINUTES TO WRITE
THE CANCELLATION MESSAGE.

354
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,742
WELCOME PARTY

355
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,119
We made it!

356
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,538
Thank you for your hard work, everybody!

357
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,834
{\an8}Principal, please stop giving us
last minute notices.

358
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,961
{\an8}I understand.

359
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,757
Then, have fun, everybody!

360
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,802
Can you speak French, Shinomiya?

361
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,847
No, I'm not very good at it.

362
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,098
How about you?

363
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,268
How are you, mademoiselle?

364
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,104
My name is Miyuki Shirogane.

365
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,024
As expected of the president.

366
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,527
I just learned some lessons
from the handbook quickly.

367
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,737
Bonjour!

368
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,491
Thank you very much
for your invitation today.

369
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,622
We would like to thank you
for coming this far.

370
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:05,042
We will do our best to make sure that

371
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,628
you are left with a lasting memory
of your stay with us.

372
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,004
Thank you very much.

373
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,923
<i>Liar!</i>

374
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:15,135
The majority of Japanese content
is focused on the domestic market.

375
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,180
-Japan hasn't discovered a way yet...
-Hey, you can speak French?

376
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,223
Yes.

377
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,558
My mother used to be a diplomat,

378
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,229
so she drilled several foreign languages
into my mind since I was a child.

379
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,855
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

380
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,443
<i>Am I the only one here
who can't speak French?</i>

381
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,321
<i>Complete isolation.</i>

382
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,115
<i>What should I do?</i>

383
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,575
<i>If it's found out that I am the only one
who can't speak it...</i>

384
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,745
The President
of the Japanese High School Council

385
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,955
can't speak French?

386
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,207
Maybe he is stupid, right?

387
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,548
How cute.

388
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,175
<i>It's no use. My chest hurts.</i>

389
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,095
<i>Shirogane.</i>

390
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:03,016
<i>Why do you think I had you organize
this party suddenly?</i>

391
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:08,522
<i>I had to make sure you are worthy enough
for me to entrust this school to you.</i>

392
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,900
<i>Now, the real test begins.</i>

393
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,861
Betsy.

394
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,362
Yes.

395
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,322
No need to hold back.

396
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,950
Please chop up that Shirogane boy

397
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,578
with all of your strength.

398
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,871
Are you sure?

399
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,665
<i>The French High School
Student Council Vice President,</i>

400
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,125
{\an8}<i>Beltoise Betsy.</i>

401
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,086
<i>The girl is called
"The Wounds-Licking Razor"</i>

402
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,132
<i>No one has ever survived
her verbal attacks.</i>

403
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,384
Bonjour.

404
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,227
<i>Betsy charges on him with sarcasm
that levels a punch in the head.</i>

405
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,354
Yes.

406
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,567
<i>Next, she provokes him as if insulting
his parents and lover at the same time.</i>

407
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:58,197
Yes.

408
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,198
<i>Additionally,</i>

409
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,243
<i>a character assassination that would make
60-year-old men break down in tears.</i>

410
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,331
Exactly.

411
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,958
<i>Miyuki Shirogane!</i>

412
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,879
<i>Responding to that dreadful attack
just by keeping a smile on your face...</i>

413
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,174
<i>If it were me, I would already be bowing
on the ground in my own vomit.</i>

414
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,051
<i>You could almost think that</i>

415
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,470
-<i>he doesn't understand what she says.</i>
-Exactly!

416
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,223
<i>My attack isn't working.</i>

417
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,183
<i>That's impossible!</i>

418
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:30,562
<i>Betsy shouts severe insults at him.</i>

419
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,231
Yes.

420
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,067
You son of a...

421
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,407
What did you just say?

422
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,284
Oh, forgive me.

423
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,578
You don't understand Japanese?

424
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,256
<i>Kaguya threatens Betsy with a language</i>

425
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,384
<i>that could get her in trouble
with the Broadcasting Code.</i>

426
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,558
Shinomiya?

427
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,936
President?

428
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,813
It's not what you think.

429
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,440
She is going to kill me!

430
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,650
I am sorry.

431
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,402
Are you all right?

432
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,154
Japanese high school girls are scary.

433
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,240
<i>Oh, what have I done?</i>

434
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,618
<i>Today's result,
the Japanese school has won.</i>

435
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,420
You despise me now, don't you?

436
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,840
After talking so foul...

437
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:44,344
That was just like the old me.

438
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,722
Like I told you,

439
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,890
I only know a few French phrases.

440
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,642
I couldn't make out your words.

441
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,937
That's why I don't know what you said.

442
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,897
But...

443
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,276
I understood that
you were mad at her for insulting me.

444
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,654
Thank you.

445
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,822
President?

446
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,242
That quality of yours is...

447
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,579
I think.

448
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,623
What?

449
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,000
What did you say?

450
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,335
It's a secret.

451
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,628
Hey, don't be like that.

452
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,047
I want to know!

453
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,715
A secret is a secret.

454
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,300
-What did you say?
<i>-Today's result...</i>

455
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,886
-It wasn't in French.
<i>-they both won.</i>

456
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,721
-Was it Yiddish?
-No.

457
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,097
Was it Finnish?

458
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,228
