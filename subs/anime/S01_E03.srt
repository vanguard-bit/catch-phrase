00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:02,377
<i>When you fall in love with someone,</i>

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,296
<i>you confess your love
and it'll be accepted.</i>

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,551
<i>Anyone would tell you
that it's a wonderful thing,</i>

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,010
<i>but everything is wrong about that!</i>

5
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,433
<i>Love is a war!</i>

6
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:24,816
<i>The moment you fall in love, you lose.</i>

00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,077
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,036
Hey.

9
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,163
LOVE RIVALS

10
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,248
What is this?

11
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,918
{\an8}The principal just confiscated it
from a student.

12
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,088
{\an8}It's an educationally damaging book,
so he told me to dispose of it.

13
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,256
Really now.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,341
He could have done it himself.

15
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,760
A book with damaging content?

16
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,139
DISORDER

17
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,056
Disorder!

18
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,974
NOT DISORDER,
DEBAUCHERY

19
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:21,891
They meant "obscenity!"

20
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,852
This country is falling into debauchery.

21
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,479
<i>Why is she panicking like that?</i>

22
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,984
<i>-Was it a pornographic book?
-Shirogane showed a deep interest.</i>

23
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,569
-What is this?
-Kaguya, don't look!

24
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,072
A survey on when people had
their first time.

25
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,492
Thirty-four percent of them
said "before high school."

26
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,660
That's a lie!

27
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,829
There's no way people are doing that.

28
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,664
<i>Thirty-four percent!</i>

29
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,208
<i>In other words, a third!</i>

30
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,670
<i>In a class of thirty people,
ten are experienced.</i>

31
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,297
<i>Of these three people,</i>

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,716
<i>there is a high possibility
that one of them has had sex.</i>

33
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,427
The percentage is so high because all
the people answering the questions

34
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,138
are people who read books like these.

35
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,099
That's a sample selection bias.

36
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,393
There is no way so many people
are experienced in reality.

37
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,728
Right?

38
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,188
Is that so?

39
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,733
I think it's an appropriate ratio.

40
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,694
It's actually a little small.

41
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,571
Um...

42
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,656
I couldn't believe it to be true,

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,368
but have you already
experienced that, Kaguya?

44
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,120
Yes, a long time ago.

45
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,376
Is the code for Aomori Area 017?

46
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,836
That's surprising.

47
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,215
When people become high school students
they are already experienced?

48
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,676
But they mostly grew up in an environment
that lacks love and affection.

49
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,680
-It might be good for me...
-The area code for Oshamanbe is...

50
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,974
-...to get a boyfriend soon.
-...013.

51
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:50,855
-My father won't forgive me, though.
<i>-Kaguya noticed their impatient reactions.</i>

52
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,274
<i>When people compare themselves</i>

53
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,027
<i>and notice they got a late start,
they panic.</i>

54
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,612
<i>And through this impatience,</i>

55
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,615
<i>they are driven by the feeling
that they should get a partner soon.</i>

56
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,658
<i>In other words...</i>

57
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,535
Am I too late
to experience that kind of things?

58
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,329
I AM LATE?

59
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,330
I NEED A GIRLFRIEND

60
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,623
SHINOMIYA, PLEASE DATE ME!

61
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,088
Shinomiya, please go out with me!

62
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,589
<i>He will confess to me!</i>

63
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,676
<i>Kaguya has already decided
on her plan for the day.</i>

64
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,094
What stupid talk.

65
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:25,223
So, President, are you doubting
if you are truly popular with the girls?

66
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,683
<i>She stirs him up.</i>

67
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,184
Don't you have a girlfriend?

68
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,394
<i>She stirs him up!</i>

69
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,396
Oh, that's right.

70
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,275
I don't have a relationship
with a special someone.

71
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:36,818
Not now, at least.

72
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,530
<i>"Not now!" That implies that he had
a girlfriend a while ago,</i>

73
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,657
<i>but since, in fact, he never dated anyone,</i>

74
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,201
<i>it's also not a lie, so it's a
very convenient word choice.</i>

75
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,038
<i>This word is loved across the world
by young and elderly people alike.</i>

76
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,625
<i>So, Miyuki Shirogane doesn't have
any romantic experiences.</i>

77
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,421
<i>But it's not like Shirogane
isn't popular at all.</i>

78
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,465
<i>I would actually say he is very popular.</i>

79
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,260
<i>Perhaps we should just say
that birds of a feather flock together</i>

80
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:06,639
<i>or consider that strange people
are attracted to strange people?</i>

81
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,393
<i>Because he tends to only
attract dangerous people,</i>

82
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,646
<i>he has never had a romantic relationship.</i>

83
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,193
<i>Why am I popular among such people?</i>

84
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,822
<i>Therefore, because of his
lack of experience in such things,</i>

85
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,784
<i>he developed a strong self-confidence
based on the fact that he is popular.</i>

86
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,539
<i>They are surely attracted
to my overflowing intelligence.</i>

87
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,916
<i>Should I feel guilty?</i>

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,002
<i>-Men like him with endless confidence...</i>
-Not now...

89
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,671
<i>-...and a chaste purity,</i>
-...at least.

90
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,715
<i>made him into what he is today which is...</i>

91
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:41,841
Not now, at least.

92
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,260
<i>the monster virgin.</i>

93
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,890
<i>-But the weakness of that monster...</i>
-Of course, they have experience.

94
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:55,104
<i>There's no changing the fact
that he's a virgin.</i>

95
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,190
<i>Lying is the simplest thing to do,</i>

96
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,942
<i>but to tell someone experienced
that you also have experience</i>

97
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,653
<i>is as reckless as a movie amateur
trying to trick a movie maniac</i>

98
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,156
<i>that he knows a lot about movies.</i>

99
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,616
<i>Even if I were to lie like that,</i>

100
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,159
I do it all the time!

101
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,911
Are you boasting about it?

102
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:14,332
Were you afraid that people would find out
about your chaste travels?

103
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,834
How cute of you.

104
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,503
<i>She would definitely find out.</i>

105
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,547
Well, if I felt like it,
I'd get a girlfriend anytime...

106
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,841
<i>He hangs on as strong as he can.</i>

107
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,426
Is that so?

108
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,099
I thought since you have a little sister,

109
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,810
you must be doing it with her
all the time.

110
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,561
That is...

111
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,688
No way!

112
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,107
Are you an idiot?

113
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,566
Well, you are family.

114
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,736
I did it all the time
with my newborn nephew.

115
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,822
I also filmed it.

116
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,823
You're crazy!

117
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,449
I miss it, to be honest.

118
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,869
It won't do, you know.

119
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,122
To fear human contact that much.

120
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,792
This is also the bewilderment
of the current society.

121
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,168
No, it's you!

122
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,462
You are the bewilderment of the nobility!

123
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,297
<i>What is so strange?</i>

124
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,050
<i>Fujiwara does it with pets all the time.</i>

125
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,051
Do you?

126
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,220
I don't! Don't get involved, please!

127
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,474
<i>Is the Shinomiya family's
educational course this wrong?</i>

128
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,229
<i>What I held for common sense
is something she has no clue about?</i>

129
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,317
Shinomiya.

130
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,194
I want to ask you just in case,

131
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,281
do you know what it means
when they say "it's your first time?"

132
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,742
Don't make fun of me, please.

133
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,704
I know what the "first time" means.

134
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,497
It's when you kiss someone.

135
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,713
Good grief.

136
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,715
<i>Kaguya Shinomiya.</i>

137
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,258
<i>As the eldest daughter of the family,</i>

138
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:51,304
<i>for the past 16 years, since infantry,
she was kept away from sexual education.</i>

139
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,349
<i>All she knows about sex ends with kissing.</i>

140
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,392
THE END

141
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,229
<i>Beyond that, her awareness
is at the level of those urban legends.</i>

142
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,149
The stork doesn't have
anything to do with it, right?

143
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,652
<i>She's an extremely sheltered girl.</i>

144
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,073
<i>Of course, she has no way of knowing
what the "first time" is.</i>

145
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,241
Shinomiya.

146
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,952
President, I'll take it from here.

147
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,748
Kaguya.

148
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,170
What they mean here with
"the first time" is...

149
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,676
They do... that.

150
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,055
Then they take off their underwear...

151
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:38,142
and then they... like beasts...

152
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,811
16 MINUTES LATER

153
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,277
<i>But...</i>

154
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,323
that kind of thing is only legal
when you're married!

155
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,701
<i>I thought my heart stopped.</i>

156
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,205
TODAY'S RESULTS. SHINOMIYA LOST.

157
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,373
<i>Today's results,</i>

158
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,792
<i>Shinomiya lost.</i>

159
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,923
Shirogane.

160
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,300
I don't approve of intercourse.

161
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,511
Would you do it alone, please?

162
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,989
{\an8}It's a quiet night.

163
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,657
{\an8}That's true.

164
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,828
It's Fujiwara's turn to walk Pes today,
so she went home earlier.

165
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,621
Pes! Pes!

166
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:45,126
And Ishigami, the accountant,
came and went out of here at some point.

167
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,631
He should simply get a prize
for having perfect attendance, right?

168
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,181
Compared to earlier,
you are much rounder now, Shinomiya.

169
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,018
Do you mean I got fat?

170
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,980
No, I meant your personality.
Don't go saying something corny.

171
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,232
That's right.

172
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,737
I made an effort to be liked by
people a little more.

173
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,822
Was that it?

174
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,620
I wonder if I came to understand
what kind of person you are.

175
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,540
You mean if you know me?

176
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,043
Really?

177
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,963
It's been six months since we started
working together in the Student Council.

178
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,965
I thought the work itself
made me know you.

179
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,636
If that's so, let's put it to the test.

180
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,803
A test?

181
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,724
Yes, to see how much you understand me.

182
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,850
Let's try it out.

183
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,730
Do you know the 20 questions game?

184
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,232
<i>The 20 questions game.</i>

185
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,443
<i>-The one asking the question can ask...</i>
-Size of a palm?

186
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,071
<i>-...20 times to find out the answer...</i>
-Yes.

187
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:59,158
<i>But you can only ask
questions answerable by yes or no.</i>

188
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:03,287
<i>If they find out what it is
with 20 questions, the person wins.</i>

189
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,414
<i>If they can't,
the person being asked wins.</i>

190
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,795
But you can determine most answers
if you get to ask 20 questions.

191
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,589
If you truly understand me,

192
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,343
you should be able to find out
by only asking 10 questions.

193
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,469
I see.

194
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,805
I am okay with that.

195
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,767
Are you ready?

196
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,684
Yes.

197
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,817
{\an8}Then, the first question is...

198
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,737
One, is it something I can touch?

199
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,533
Yes. It's not a word or an idea.

200
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,535
Two. Is it an electronic device?

201
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,373
Three. Is it something
that can be warm or cold?

202
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,919
<i>From her last answer, I can deduce that</i>

203
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:56,799
<i>it's either a living being,
food, hot water or ice,</i>

204
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,136
<i>an open fire,
or a temperature control device.</i>

205
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:05,141
<i>But this is a test of how much
I understand Shinomiya.</i>

206
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,060
<i>The answer is something
that has to do with her.</i>

207
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,062
<i>If that's the case...</i>

208
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:14,191
Four. Is it something you possess?

209
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,071
Five. Is it something you touched today?

210
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,992
Six. Is it something you have at home?

211
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,039
<i>So far there were three consecutive "no."</i>

212
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,042
<i>I thought it was something she owned,</i>

213
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,252
<i>but I got confused.</i>

214
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,797
<i>I should dig around her psyche
a little bit more.</i>

215
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,090
Then it's...

216
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,509
Seven. Is it something you like?

217
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,347
Yes.

218
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,436
<i>What's with that expression?</i>

219
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,107
<i>It's like she's a little embarrassed,
a little bashful.</i>

220
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,693
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

221
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,991
Eight. Is it a living being?

222
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,372
Yes.

223
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,707
<i>Is it...</i>

224
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,003
<i>Is it me?</i>

225
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,297
<i>Calm down a little. Let's confirm it.</i>

226
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,050
<i>You can touch it.</i>

227
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,010
<i>It's not an electric device.</i>

228
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,595
<i>It doesn't have a constant temperature.</i>

229
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,555
<i>She doesn't possess it.</i>

230
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,932
<i>She didn't touch it today.</i>

231
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,558
<i>It's not in her house, of course.</i>

232
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,894
<i>All the conditions are met.</i>

233
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,230
<i>Then, something that Shinomiya likes...</i>

234
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,734
<i>Is this an indirect confession of love?</i>

235
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,615
Nine. What do you mean by "like"?

236
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,537
As friends or people or something else?

237
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,915
I can't answer that.

238
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,793
It's not answerable by yes or no.

239
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,962
<i>Damn it!</i>

240
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,505
<i>I panicked and wasted a question.</i>

241
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,839
<i>Calm down.</i>

242
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,592
<i>It's still possible
that she means someone else.</i>

243
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,304
Then...

244
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:08,931
Ten.

245
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,933
Is it someone smart and handsome,

246
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:15,020
with blond hair, and well-defined eyes?

247
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,188
Is that it?

248
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,199
<i>It's me!</i>

249
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,245
<i>Who she means is me! It's definitely, me.</i>

250
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,164
<i>Good grief, Shinomiya.</i>

251
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,959
<i>That's one twisted love confession.</i>

252
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,963
<i>So many things happened so far.</i>

253
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,172
<i>That's right.</i>

254
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,925
<i>Each time I tried to understand
her as a person.</i>

255
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,679
<i>To understand...</i>

256
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,723
<i>What?</i>

257
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,063
Then, are you done with the questions?

258
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,358
You can tell me the answer.

259
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,402
<i>That's how it was.</i>

260
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:07,948
<i>Do I understand at all
what kind of person Shinomiya is?</i>

261
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,075
During times like this,
Shinomiya always...

262
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,619
The answer is...

263
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,331
a dog.

264
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,082
Damn.

265
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,418
That's the correct answer.

266
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,671
<i>Accurately put, it's Pes, Fujiwara's dog.</i>

267
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,964
{\an8}<i>So, shall we go back?</i>

268
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,633
{\an8}PESU (SMILE)

269
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,760
It's already late, right?

270
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,220
That's right.

271
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,852
<i>Today's test results are...</i>

272
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,729
<i>success.</i>

273
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,566
BECAUSE SHIROGANE UNDERSTOOD SHINOMIYA'S
PERSONALITY SOME WAY OR ANOTHER.

274
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,568
PES IS REALLY SIMILAR TO HIM

275
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,446
<i>Kaguya Shinomiya, the eldest daughter
of the Shinomiya group.</i>

276
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,324
<i>Which is a part of an old financial group.</i>

277
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,410
{\an8}<i>Her life was decided for her
since she was born,</i>

278
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,538
{\an8}<i>or rather, even before she was born.</i>

279
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,248
<i>For example...</i>

280
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,004
<i>Two thousand, five hundred
and seventy-four times.</i>

281
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:09,051
<i>The number of times she watched through
the window while being driven to school.</i>

282
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,387
SHINOMIYA

283
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,097
<i>However, on that day...</i>

284
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,306
Is it a cat?

285
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,600
Yes.

286
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,895
She got inside the engine room.

287
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,858
I am arranging for another car, so
please wait for a little while.

288
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,277
If that's the case, I will walk today.

289
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,613
At least, go with Hayasaka, please.

290
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,949
Well, I don't really mind...

291
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,914
If she had to wait for me to change,
she would be late for school,

292
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,208
so I think it's best for her to go alone.

293
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,003
See? Even Hayasaka thinks so.
I'll be all right.

294
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,380
Miss Kaguya!

295
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,881
See you later!

296
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:56,432
<i>Under the lively sun,
her breathing gets a little livelier.</i>

297
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,530
<i>Well...</i>

298
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,825
<i>I might not get another chance
to walk to school.</i>

299
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,453
<i>I have to use this precious occasion.</i>

300
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,662
<i>If that's so...</i>

301
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,416
<i>the president is
cycling from Setagaya or so.</i>

302
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,502
{\an8}<i>Then he would come via Meiji street.</i>

303
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,839
<i>He always gets to school a little late,</i>

304
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,508
<i>so if I wait by the bridge, surely...</i>

305
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,236
Well,

306
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,572
if I don't hurry up, I'll miss him.

307
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,456
What's wrong?

308
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,461
If you have a problem,
tell me about it quickly and concisely.

309
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,548
Pedestrian... crossing...

310
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,050
The pedestrian crossing?

311
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,516
Okay, then, let's cross it together.

312
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,736
You can let go of my hand now.

313
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,367
There are many pedestrian crossings
on the way to school.

314
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,626
So...

315
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,379
how have you been
getting to school so far?

316
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,548
We go to school in groups.

317
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,177
Yeti always holds my hand usually.

318
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,720
The snowman?

319
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,014
He has a home made of ice,
so that's why we call him Yeti.

320
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,645
But I'm in the sixth grade now,
so we can't go in a group.

321
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,897
That's why I am alone.

322
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,742
<i>She thinks entirely like a third grader.</i>

323
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,246
<i>When I was her age,
I was more put together.</i>

324
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,628
I am alone.

325
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,172
I wish we were all together!

326
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,720
Hey, there.

327
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,931
Just because you don't
go to school in a group,

328
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,310
it doesn't mean you have to go alone.

329
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,690
You can tell your friends to meet you
or wait for you or go to meet them.

330
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,734
Wouldn't it be nice to go together?

331
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,152
Right?

332
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,238
You're smart!

333
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,948
Are you a genius?

334
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,867
Something like that.

335
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,827
Mikiti!

336
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,371
Yeti!

337
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,666
Then, you're okay now, right?

338
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,834
Go!

339
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,672
Bye-bye, genius girl!

340
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,093
Good morning. You surprised me!

341
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,803
Good morning! You surprised me, too!

342
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,681
-Let's go to school together!
-Okay.

343
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,685
By the way, where am I now?

344
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,400
It's 8:25 AM.

345
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,735
I am late.

346
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,989
If they found out I was late,

347
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,200
they won't ever let me

348
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,661
go to school alone again.

349
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,415
One time was enough for me.

350
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,834
I just wanted to see how it's like.

351
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,218
I wish I could go to school with someone.

352
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,643
President?

353
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,560
Shinomiya?

354
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,229
What are you doing here?

355
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,356
The classes are about to start!

356
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,192
You too, President. Don't tell me you...

357
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,193
I never was.

358
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,696
I was never late at one time in my life.

359
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,739
More than that, you're
the problem, Shinomiya!

360
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,284
If you walk, you will surely be late!

361
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,787
You can't be late as a member
of the Shuchiin Student Council!

362
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,789
Climb on my back.

363
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,748
We're going!

364
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,793
If being late is bad,
the two of us on the bike would be...

365
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,877
Shut up!

366
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,256
School regulation takes precedence
over the Road Traffic Act for us!

367
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,363
The next day,

368
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,034
Kaguya was being driven to school
as usual, but...

369
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,579
Can we go?

370
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,913
-Yes!
-<i>There are times...</i>

371
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,627
<i>when she would smile while remembering it.</i>

372
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,893
